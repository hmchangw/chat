// Package natsrouter provides Gin-style pattern-based routing for NATS
// request/reply services with typed handlers, middleware, and automatic
// JSON marshal/unmarshal.
//
// # Concurrency model
//
// The router spawns one goroutine per incoming message. By default
// there is NO admission control — the model is analogous to HTTP/2's
// per-stream goroutine model (one goroutine per request, not per
// connection). Backpressure flows from downstream timeouts
// (HandlerTimeout middleware, ctx-aware database drivers).
//
// Under the unbounded default, callers that hit a timeout receive a
// generic {"error":"internal error"} reply unless the handler maps
// context.DeadlineExceeded to ErrUnavailable explicitly:
//
//	if errors.Is(err, context.DeadlineExceeded) {
//	    return nil, natsrouter.ErrUnavailable("request timed out")
//	}
//
// Without that mapping there is no structured retry signal in the
// default path.
//
// For services that need a hard cap on in-flight handlers (memory-
// constrained pods, downstream pools that don't queue cleanly, etc.),
// opt into admission control with WithMaxConcurrency(N) at construction.
// When admission is on, a non-blocking acquire on a semaphore inside
// the per-subscription dispatcher gates each spawn:
//
//   - On acquire success, the router spawns the handler goroutine.
//   - On acquire failure (cap reached), the router publishes an
//     ErrUnavailable reply ({"error":"service busy","code":"unavailable"})
//     and returns. Callers should retry with backoff.
//
// Per-route concurrency overrides are not supported today. The Registrar
// interface is intentionally minimal so a future wrapper (e.g. a route
// group with its own admission semaphore) can be added without breaking
// the existing API.
//
// # Fire-and-forget routes
//
// RegisterVoid handlers, by their typed shape, are designed for
// callers that publish via nc.Publish — no Reply subject is set on the
// message.
//
// When admission control is enabled (WithMaxConcurrency) and the
// semaphore is saturated, such fire-and-forget messages are SILENTLY
// DROPPED: the router has no reply channel on which to publish
// ErrUnavailable, so callers get no signal that the message was
// dropped (a slog.Warn log line is emitted server-side keyed by
// subject). Size MaxConcurrency conservatively for services that
// expose RegisterVoid endpoints, or front them with JetStream so
// dropped messages can be redelivered. Under the default unbounded
// configuration this drop path is unreachable; every accepted message
// spawns a handler goroutine.
//
// # Queue-group fairness under saturation
//
// When admission control is enabled (WithMaxConcurrency), NATS
// queue-group routing distributes messages among subscribers without
// knowing whether any individual subscriber's process-level admission
// control is full. A saturated pod will continue to receive (and
// busy-reply) its share of messages even while other pods in the
// queue group sit idle. Operators should monitor the per-pod
// busy-reply rate (or set up server-side auto-scaling on it) rather
// than assume queue-group routing alone provides load balancing.
//
// # Ordering
//
// Per-subject FIFO ordering is NOT preserved. Two messages that arrive
// on the same subscription are spawned into independent goroutines and
// race; whichever wins the goroutine schedule runs first. Handlers must
// be idempotent or use external coordination (e.g. Cassandra LWTs,
// Mongo conditional updates) to ensure correctness under concurrent
// invocation.
//
// # Panic safety
//
// The router installs a process-safety backstop in every spawned
// handler goroutine: an unrecovered panic is caught at the spawn
// site, logged with stack trace, and (if the message has a Reply
// subject) replied to with "internal error". This guarantees the
// process cannot be crashed by a single bad handler regardless of
// middleware configuration. Recovery middleware (registered via
// r.Use(Recovery())) is still the recommended path because it
// produces structured ErrInternal replies enriched with request-ID
// and other middleware-set fields; the spawn-site backstop is
// strictly a defense-in-depth catch.
//
// # Shutdown
//
// Router.Shutdown drains every subscription, waits for the dispatcher
// goroutines to exit (SubscriptionClosed), and then waits on a
// WaitGroup that tracks every spawned handler goroutine. The full
// shutdown returns only after all in-flight handlers have completed or
// the context expires (whichever comes first).
//
