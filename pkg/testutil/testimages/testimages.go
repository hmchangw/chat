// Package testimages pins the container images used by integration tests
// across every service and pkg. One central set of tags keeps the whole
// repo on identical versions, so a Cassandra or Mongo schema/behaviour
// drift is caught everywhere at once rather than in whichever service
// happens to have the newest tag today.
//
// Versions here track docker-local/compose.yaml (the authoritative prod
// local-dev stack) where practical. One intentional divergence:
// Cassandra tests pin 4.1.3 because cassandra:5 with the
// testcontainers-go module's default MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1024M routinely OOMs
// on standard GitHub Actions runners.
//
// This package is only imported by integration tests (files gated by
// //go:build integration). Keep it dependency-free.
