# Member-Add Improvements + DM-Already-Exists Frontend Fix

Three related changes, packaged together because Parts 1 and 2 share the same pipeline (`pkg/pipelines/member.go`) and the same candidate-selection path in `room-worker`; Part 3 sits alongside as a small frontend fix uncovered while investigating one of the user's reports.

1. **Part 1** — bug fix for the silent no-op when an already-org-subscribed user is added individually.
2. **Part 2** — new feature: accept `deptId` values inside the `orgs: [...]` field, alongside the existing `sectId` semantics.
3. **Part 3** — frontend fix: skip the wait-for-summaries loop in `CreateRoomDialog` when the backend reports the DM already exists, so the dialog navigates directly to the existing room instead of risking the 3-second "taking longer than expected" banner on a session-start race.

# Part 1 — Fix: Add-Member Silently No-ops When Target Already Subscribed Via Org

## Problem

When a user is already in a channel as part of an organization (their subscription was created by a prior `member.add` with `orgs: [...]`), a follow-up `member.add` that lists that user under `users: [...]` is silently accepted but does nothing meaningful — the user remains an org-only member.

Concretely, after the bug:
- `subscriptions` doc for the user exists (unchanged from the org add).
- `room_members` has a `member.type="org"` row for the org, but **no `member.type="individual"` row for the user**.
- The remove-member flow's `HasIndividualMembership` / `HasOrgMembership` distinction (`room-service/handler.go:500`) treats the user as org-only, blocking individual removal/leave operations with "org members cannot leave individually" — even though the operator explicitly added them as an individual.

## Root cause

`pkg/pipelines/member.go:50-65` — `GetNewMembersPipeline` filters candidates by the *existence* of a `subscriptions` document, with no awareness of `room_members.member.type`. Both `room-service.CountNewMembers` and `room-worker.ListNewMembers` use this pipeline.

When the target user already has a subscription (from the prior org add), the pipeline filters them out. `room-worker.processAddMembers` then hits the `len(accounts) == 0` early return at `room-worker/handler.go:714-716`, so the individual `room_members` row is never created.

The pipeline answers "does any subscription exist?" when, for individually-targeted accounts, the question should be "does an *individual* `room_members` row exist?"

## Design

Replace the filter-on-subscription pipeline (for `roomID != ""`) with a pipeline that returns each candidate plus two flags. The worker then decides what to write based on those flags.

### New pipelines

`pkg/pipelines/member.go` gains two sibling pipelines that share a private match-stage helper. Splitting capacity-counting from full-candidate-resolution avoids paying for the `room_members` lookup on the capacity path (room-service runs `CountNewMembers` on every add request).

```go
// GetCapacityCheckPipeline counts net-new subscriptions; caller appends $count.
func GetCapacityCheckPipeline(orgIDs, directAccounts []string, roomID, excludeAccount string) bson.A

// GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline returns per-candidate {account, hasSubscription, hasIndividualRoomMember} for the worker.
func GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline(orgIDs, directAccounts []string, roomID, excludeAccount string) bson.A
```

Both pipelines:
- Reuse a private `matchCandidates(orgIDs, directAccounts, excludeAccount)` helper for the `$match` stage (org/account union, bot exclusion, optional excludeAccount).
- Use the existing `(roomId, u.account)` unique index on `subscriptions` for the subscriptions lookup.

`GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` additionally:
- Uses the `users` collection's `_id` (passed via `let: {uid: "$_id"}`) to drive the `room_members` lookup as `member.type=="individual" && member.id == $$uid`. **This pairs with the existing unique index `(rid, member.type, member.id)`**, so the lookup is index-covered and constant-time per candidate. Filtering on `member.account` instead would force a scan of every individual `room_members` row for the room — quadratic in (candidates × room size). The output `account` field is still projected from `$account` for the worker's bookkeeping.
- Projects to `{ account, hasSubscription, hasIndividualRoomMember }` where each flag is `{ "$gt": [{ "$size": "$<lookup>" }, 0] }`.

Both require `roomID != ""` (panic on empty — the existence checks are meaningless without a room). The create-room capacity-check path keeps using the existing `GetNewMembersPipeline` (which takes `roomID == ""` and skips the subscriptions lookup, since no subs can exist for a not-yet-created room).

### New worker store method

`room-worker/store.go` and `store_mongo.go`:

```go
type AddMemberCandidate struct {
    Account                 string
    HasSubscription         bool
    HasIndividualRoomMember bool
}

func (s *MongoStore) ListAddMemberCandidates(
    ctx context.Context,
    orgIDs, directAccounts []string,
    roomID string,
) ([]AddMemberCandidate, error)
```

Implementation: run the new pipeline against the `users` collection; decode straight into `[]AddMemberCandidate`.

The old `ListNewMembers` method is removed — the worker is its only caller.

### Worker handler changes

`room-worker/handler.go` `processAddMembers` is restructured:

1. Call `h.store.ListAddMemberCandidates(ctx, req.Orgs, req.Users, req.RoomID)`.
2. Compute the `writeIndividuals` gate as today: `writeIndividuals = len(req.Orgs) > 0 || hadOrgsBefore`. This preserves the existing convention that individual `room_members` rows are only tracked once orgs are involved (pre-orgs rooms keep using the subscription itself as the source of truth).
3. Compute three derived sets:
   - **`needSub`** = candidates where `!HasSubscription` — these go into `BulkCreateSubscriptions`.
   - **`needIndividualRoomMember`** = candidates where `Account ∈ req.Users` && `!HasIndividualRoomMember` **and `writeIndividuals == true`** — these get a `member.type="individual"` row.
   - **Org rows** = unchanged (one per `req.Orgs` entry).
4. Early-return only when **all three** sets are empty (truly nothing to do).
5. `FindUsersByAccounts` is called for the union of `needSub` and `needIndividualRoomMember` accounts (we need `user.ID` for the `room_members.member.id` field even on the upgrade path).
6. Subscriptions are built and inserted only for `needSub`. The `IsDuplicateKeyError` swallow in `BulkCreateSubscriptions` stays as a defense-in-depth against JetStream redelivery, but is no longer load-bearing for the org→individual upgrade path.
7. Individual `room_members` rows are built for `needIndividualRoomMember`, regardless of whether the sub was just inserted or already existed.
8. The backfill loop at `room-worker/handler.go:836-867` (first-org backfill of existing subscribers) is unaffected — it runs only when `len(req.Orgs) > 0 && !hadOrgsBefore`, a different trigger. The set we backfill is "existing subscribers minus accounts we already processed in this request"; under the new design that "already processed" set is `needSub ∪ needIndividualRoomMember` (anyone whose individual row we're writing now, whether they got a new sub or just an upgrade).

For the bug scenario specifically (alice already in via org, now added individually), `hadOrgsBefore == true` so `writeIndividuals == true` and the gate is naturally satisfied.

### room-service changes

`room-service/store.go` + `store_mongo.go`: `CountNewMembers` swaps from `GetNewMembersPipeline` (with `roomID != ""`) to `GetCapacityCheckPipeline` + `$count: "n"`.

Public signature and return type are unchanged. Capacity semantics preserved: re-adding an org-only user as an individual produces a count of 0 (no new sub), so the user doesn't double-count against `maxRoomSize`. The lite pipeline skips the `room_members` lookup that the worker path needs, so capacity checks stay cheap.

The create-room path (`CountNewMembers` called with `roomID == ""`) keeps the old `GetNewMembersPipeline`.

### Behavior matrix

| Pre-state                                  | Request                  | Sub written? | Individual row written? | Org row written? |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| alice not in room                          | add alice individually   | yes          | yes                     | —                |
| alice not in room                          | add org-1 (contains alice) | yes        | no                      | yes (for org-1)  |
| alice in room via org-1 only               | add alice individually   | no (skip)    | **yes (fix)**           | —                |
| alice in room via org-1 + individual       | add alice individually   | no           | no                      | —                |
| alice in room via individual only          | add org-1 (contains alice) | no         | no                      | yes (for org-1)  |
| alice in room via org-1                    | add org-2 (contains alice) | no         | no                      | yes (for org-2)  |

### Domain field semantics on upgrade

When alice is upgraded org → individual, her existing subscription's `JoinedAt` and `HistorySharedSince` are **not** touched. The individual `room_members` row gets `Ts = acceptedAt` (the new request's accepted time), which is the right value for "when did individual membership begin." This matches the system's existing model where the subscription represents membership-into-the-room and `room_members` represents membership-source rows.

## Testing

### Unit tests (`room-worker/handler_test.go`)

Table-driven cases against `processAddMembers` covering the matrix above. Key new cases:

- **Org→individual upgrade**: pre-state has subscription + org `room_members` row; request lists user under `Users`; assert `BulkCreateSubscriptions` is **not** called (or called with empty slice), `BulkCreateRoomMembers` is called with exactly one `member.type="individual"` row.
- **Mixed add**: request lists two users — one truly new, one already org-subscribed; assert sub is created only for the new one, individual rows are created for both.
- **No-op add**: request lists a user already both individually and org-subscribed; assert handler returns without writes.
- **Duplicate org add**: request lists same org again; assert org `room_members` insert is attempted (existing unique-index dedupe still applies; no change there).

### Unit tests (`room-service/handler_test.go`)

`CountNewMembers` is mocked at the store boundary, so room-service tests don't need pipeline-level changes. Add one regression test that confirms the capacity-check path still rejects when `newCount + room.UserCount > maxRoomSize`.

### Integration tests

`room-worker/integration_test.go`:
- Seed alice with a subscription and an org `room_members` row.
- Run `processAddMembers` with `Users: ["alice"]`.
- Assert: exactly one subscription doc for alice in the room (no duplicate), and exactly one individual `room_members` row for alice.

`room-service/integration_test.go`:
- Same pre-state.
- Call `CountNewMembers(orgIDs=nil, directAccounts=["alice"], roomID)`.
- Assert the result is 0 (capacity unchanged).

### Coverage gate

The CLAUDE.md 80% minimum applies; the new pipeline + store method should be at 90%+ given they're core business logic.

## Out of scope

- **Cross-site (OUTBOX) replay semantics.** The bug exists in the local `room-worker` path; cross-site `MemberAddEvent` handling uses a different code path that doesn't go through `ListNewMembers`. A spot-check of that path will be part of implementation, but a fix there (if needed) is a separate spec.
- **`docs/client-api.md`.** The wire request/response shapes for `member.add` are unchanged. The CLAUDE.md client-API gate doesn't apply.
- **Backfill of already-broken state.** Existing channels where alice is org-only but the operator intended individual membership won't auto-heal; a remediation job is out of scope. The operator can re-trigger `member.add` with `Users: ["alice"]` after this fix ships and it will create the missing row.

# Part 2 — Feature: Accept DeptId in `Orgs` Matching

## Motivation

Today, the `orgs: [...]` field in `member.add` and `room.create` is interpreted strictly as a list of `sectId`s — the pipeline at `pkg/pipelines/member.go:31` filters `users` on `sectId IN orgIDs`. Operators want to onboard whole departments without enumerating every constituent section. The fix accepts a `deptId` anywhere a `sectId` is accepted, with no API surface change.

## Domain assumption (confirmed)

In the operator's data, sectIds are unique across departments. When an ID exists as both a deptId (for some users) and a sectId (for others), the dept interpretation is a superset of the sect interpretation — every `sectId=X` user is also `deptId=X`. This lets us prefer the dept interpretation on overlap without losing members. This is a property of the source HR/directory data, not enforced by the chat system.

## User model changes

`pkg/model/user.go`:

```go
type User struct {
    ID          string `json:"id"           bson:"_id"`
    Account     string `json:"account"      bson:"account"`
    SiteID      string `json:"siteId"       bson:"siteId"`
    SectID      string `json:"sectId"       bson:"sectId"`
    SectName    string `json:"sectName"     bson:"sectName"`
    SectTCName  string `json:"sectTCName"   bson:"sectTCName"`  // NEW
    DeptID      string `json:"deptId"       bson:"deptId"`      // NEW
    DeptName    string `json:"deptName"     bson:"deptName"`    // NEW
    DeptTCName  string `json:"deptTCName"   bson:"deptTCName"`  // NEW
    EngName     string `json:"engName"      bson:"engName"`
    ChineseName string `json:"chineseName"  bson:"chineseName"`
    EmployeeID  string `json:"employeeId"   bson:"employeeId"`
}
```

The new fields are populated by the external HR / directory sync that already owns the `users` collection (no production code in this repo writes to `users`). Existing user docs that pre-date the sync extension won't have dept fields populated; dept-based adds for those users return 0 candidates — same outcome as adding an unknown `orgId` today.

## Pipeline changes

Both `GetNewMembersPipeline` (create-room) and the new `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` introduced in Part 1 extend their `$match.$or`:

```go
if len(orgIDs) > 0 {
    orFilter = append(orFilter, bson.M{"sectId": bson.M{"$in": orgIDs}})
    orFilter = append(orFilter, bson.M{"deptId": bson.M{"$in": orgIDs}})  // NEW
}
```

Per-account dedup via the terminal `$addToSet $account` (or, for `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline`, grouping by `account`) handles the case where a single user matches both clauses (e.g., `user.sectId=X` and `user.deptId=Y`, both in `orgIDs`) — only one candidate row per account.

No tiebreak is needed at this stage. The tiebreak lives in the read paths below.

## Read-path tiebreak: prefer dept on overlap

The room-member display and remove-org sys-message resolve a single rendered string per `member.id` row. Two steps:

1. **Pick the winning interpretation.** Per the domain assumption, when `member.id` exists as both a deptId and a sectId, the dept's `(deptName, deptTCName)` pair wins.
2. **Format the rendered name.** The chosen pair is concatenated as `name + " " + tcName`, mirroring the existing `displayName(user) = engName + " " + chineseName` convention in `room-worker/sysmsg.go:10-25`. Empty-component fallbacks follow the same pattern (if either is empty, return the non-empty one; if both empty, the caller's "no name" branch fires).

The combined string is what appears in member-list display rows, in the system-message `Content` field, and in the `MemberRemoved.SectName` structured payload — same shape consumers see today, with broadened semantics.

The existing `displayName(user)` helper in `room-worker/sysmsg.go:10-25` already encodes the same "combine two names with a space, fall back to the non-empty one, then fall back to a third value" pattern (today the third value is `user.Account`). Extract the shared core into a new package `pkg/displayfmt` so both `room-worker` (sys-messages) and `room-service` (member-list enrichment) can use one canonical implementation:

```go
// pkg/displayfmt/combine.go
package displayfmt

import "strings"

// CombineWithFallback joins first and second with a space; returns the non-empty side or fallback when both are empty.
func CombineWithFallback(first, second, fallback string) string {
    first = strings.TrimSpace(first)
    second = strings.TrimSpace(second)
    switch {
    case first == "" && second == "":
        return fallback
    case first == "":
        return second
    case second == "":
        return first
    case first == second:
        return first
    default:
        return first + " " + second
    }
}
```

`room-worker/sysmsg.go` collapses its existing 16-line `displayName` to a one-line wrapper and adds `displayOrg`:

```go
func displayName(u *model.User) string  { return displayfmt.CombineWithFallback(u.EngName, u.ChineseName, u.Account) }
func displayOrg(name, tcName, orgID string) string { return displayfmt.CombineWithFallback(name, tcName, orgID) }

func formatRemovedOrg(name, tcName, orgID string) string {
    return quoted(displayOrg(name, tcName, orgID)) + " has been removed from the channel"
}
```

`room-service/store_mongo.go ListRoomMembers` uses `displayfmt.CombineWithFallback` directly in its decode loop (see the enrichment section below).

The MongoDB pipeline does NOT replicate the combine logic — it returns the raw `{name, tcName}` pair and the Go side combines once on read. This eliminates the BSON↔Go duplication and saves pipeline stages on the member-list hot path.

### Enrichment join (`room-service/store_mongo.go:451-472`)

The `_orgMatch` `$lookup`'s inner pipeline stays at 3 stages — match → addFields → group — matching today's stage count. Pipeline emits raw `{name, tcName, memberCount}` and the Go decode applies `combineWithFallback`. This avoids duplicating the helper logic in BSON and is a strict perf win on the member-list hot path:

```go
pipeline: bson.A{
    bson.M{"$match": bson.M{"$expr": bson.M{"$and": bson.A{
        bson.M{"$eq": bson.A{"$$mtyp", "org"}},
        bson.M{"$or": bson.A{
            bson.M{"$eq": bson.A{"$deptId", "$$orgId"}},
            bson.M{"$eq": bson.A{"$sectId", "$$orgId"}},
        }},
    }}}},
    bson.M{"$addFields": bson.M{
        // Per-row name pair from whichever side matched; $max(_isDept) in the $group then picks dept-first.
        "_isDept": bson.M{"$eq": bson.A{"$deptId", "$$orgId"}},
        "_name":   bson.M{"$cond": bson.A{bson.M{"$eq": bson.A{"$deptId", "$$orgId"}}, "$deptName", "$sectName"}},
        "_tcName": bson.M{"$cond": bson.A{bson.M{"$eq": bson.A{"$deptId", "$$orgId"}}, "$deptTCName", "$sectTCName"}},
    }},
    bson.M{"$group": bson.M{
        // $max on _isDept tells the Go decoder whether any dept row exists; pair with the matching name.
        "_id":         nil,
        "isDept":      bson.M{"$max": "$_isDept"},
        "deptName":    bson.M{"$max": bson.M{"$cond": bson.A{"$_isDept", "$_name", nil}}},
        "deptTCName":  bson.M{"$max": bson.M{"$cond": bson.A{"$_isDept", "$_tcName", nil}}},
        "sectName":    bson.M{"$max": bson.M{"$cond": bson.A{"$_isDept", nil, "$_name"}}},
        "sectTCName":  bson.M{"$max": bson.M{"$cond": bson.A{"$_isDept", nil, "$_tcName"}}},
        "memberCount": bson.M{"$sum": 1},
    }},
},
```

The outer `$set display` block (`store_mongo.go:475-489`) pulls **raw** name pairs into a temporary `display.orgRaw` sub-doc instead of constructing the combined string in the pipeline:

```go
"orgRaw": bson.M{"$arrayElemAt": bson.A{"$_orgMatch", 0}},
"memberCount": bson.M{"$arrayElemAt": bson.A{"$_orgMatch.memberCount", 0}},
```

`ListRoomMembers` Go decode loop then resolves the final string with the dept-first preference and orgId fallback, reusing the same `combineWithFallback` helper as the worker:

```go
for i := range members {
    if members[i].Member.Type != model.RoomMemberOrg {
        continue
    }
    raw := members[i].Display.OrgRaw
    name, tcName := raw.SectName, raw.SectTCName
    if raw.IsDept && raw.DeptName != "" {
        name, tcName = raw.DeptName, raw.DeptTCName
    }
    members[i].Display.SectName = combineWithFallback(name, tcName, members[i].Member.ID)
}
```

The field name `display.sectName` stays unchanged for wire stability; its semantics broaden to "the resolved org display name (dept-or-sect, `name + " " + tcName`, or the raw orgId when both names are empty)." Both paths (sys-message in worker, member-list in service) emit byte-identical strings for the same input because they share the same Go helper.

**Net stage count:** unchanged at 3 inner stages (vs. today's 3). All BSON-Go duplication is eliminated.

### List-org-members RPC (`room-service/store_mongo.go:707`)

The `chat.user.{account}.request.orgs.{orgId}.members` endpoint (the "expand org" RPC the client calls to enumerate an org row in the member roster) was sectId-only. Under the broadened semantics it must resolve a deptId-added org just as it resolves a sectId-added org — otherwise the roster shows the org row but expansion returns `errInvalidOrg`.

`ListOrgMembers` switches from `Find({sectId: orgId})` to:

```go
cursor, err := s.users.Find(ctx, bson.M{"$or": []bson.M{
    {"sectId": orgID},
    {"deptId": orgID},
}}, opts)
```

This is the symmetric companion to the `GetSubscriptionWithMembership` / `GetUserWithMembership` dept-aware lookups landed earlier in this PR — same `$or` shape, same indexes covering both branches. Under the operator's domain assumption (dept ⊇ sect for any overlapping id), a deptId-added org returns the dept's full membership; a sectId-only org returns just the sect's members. The wire response shape and `errInvalidOrg` semantics are unchanged.

Test coverage (integration, `room-service/integration_test.go::TestMongoStore_ListOrgMembers_Integration`):
- `matches_by_deptId` — users with distinct `sectId` and `deptId`; query by `deptId` returns dept rows the sect-only filter would have missed.
- `matches dept users when orgId equals deptId without parent sect match` — invariant case (`sectId == deptId` for dept users); query by that id returns only the dept user.

### Remove-org name harvest (`room-worker/handler.go:514-523`)

`OrgMemberStatus` (`room-worker/store.go:31`) drops `SectName` and gains a per-row resolved pair. The pipeline does the per-row name selection (sect-fields when the row matched sectId, dept-fields when it matched deptId); the handler does the org-level dept-first tiebreak:

```go
type OrgMemberStatus struct {
    Account                 string
    SiteID                  string
    Name                    string  // resolved per-row: deptName if IsDept else sectName
    TCName                  string  // resolved per-row: deptTCName if IsDept else sectTCName
    IsDept                  bool    // true if this row matched by deptId
    HasIndividualMembership bool
}
```

`GetOrgMembersWithIndividualStatus` (`room-worker/store_mongo.go:261-294`) extends the pipeline:
- `$match: {$or: [{sectId: orgID}, {deptId: orgID}]}` — index-covered on both branches by `(sectId, account)` and the new `(deptId, account)`.
- `$addFields` computes `isDept = (deptId == orgID)`, plus `name`/`tcName` via `$cond` on `isDept`.
- `$lookup` into `room_members` with `let: {uid: "$_id"}` and the inner match `member.type=="individual" && member.id == $$uid` — index-covered by the existing unique `(rid, member.type, member.id)`. The current code matches on `member.account == "$$acct"` which is *not* index-covered; switch to `member.id` for constant-time per-user lookup.
- `$project` keeps `account`, `siteId`, `name`, `tcName`, `isDept`, `hasIndividualMembership` — internal `$$` vars and the lookup arrays are explicitly dropped.

`processRemoveOrg`'s name-harvest loop is replaced with a two-pass resolution that picks a single `(name, tcName)`:

1. First pass — find any row with `IsDept == true`. If found, take `(Name, TCName)` from that row.
2. Second pass — if no dept match, find first row (any). Take its `(Name, TCName)`.
3. If `members` is empty (e.g., users were deleted between request and processing), the resolved pair is `("", "")`.

The resolved pair feeds `formatRemovedOrg(name, tcName, req.OrgID)` for the sys-msg `Content`, and `displayOrg(name, tcName, req.OrgID)` populates `MemberRemoved.SectName`. The `orgId` fallback inside `displayOrg` guarantees the rendered output is never empty:

- Both names present → `"name tcName"`
- Only one present → that one
- Both empty → `orgID` (the raw sectId or deptId from the request)

**The existing `"missing SectName on all members"` permanent error at `room-worker/handler.go:521-523` is removed.** With the orgId fallback, there's no longer a need to fail an org-remove on missing names — the message degrades gracefully to showing the ID instead. The check is replaced with a `slog.Warn` if you want to surface the data-quality issue without failing the operation; alternatively, drop the log too. (Spec choice: emit the warn, since silent data-quality degradation is harder to notice.)

## Sys-message rendering: `Message.Content` is the source of truth

**Frontend renders system messages by displaying `Message.Content` directly.** The structured `SysMsgData` payload (carrying `MemberRemoved`) is preserved for non-rendering consumers (analytics, audit, future structured features) but is **not** the rendering source. This matches today's behavior — the change here only broadens what `Content` says, not how it's consumed.

Concretely, for an org-remove where the winning interpretation is `dept` with `deptName="Engineering"` and `deptTCName="工程部"`:

- `Message.Content` = `"\"Engineering 工程部\" has been removed from the channel"` — what the user sees.
- `Message.SysMsgData` = `MemberRemoved{OrgID: "...", SectName: "Engineering 工程部", RemovedUsersCount: N}` — structured copy of the same combined string in the existing `SectName` field.

### `MemberRemoved` payload shape

`model.MemberRemoved` (`pkg/model/member.go`) — **no new fields**. The existing `SectName` field carries the combined `displayOrg(name, tcName)` string:

```go
type MemberRemoved struct {
    User              *SysMsgUser `json:"user,omitempty"`
    OrgID             string      `json:"orgId,omitempty"`
    SectName          string      `json:"sectName,omitempty"`  // existing — now carries displayOrg(name, tcName)
    RemovedUsersCount int         `json:"removedUsersCount"`
}
```

This keeps the wire schema stable. The field name's semantics drift (it's no longer guaranteed to be just the sectName — it's the resolved org display string), and a future cleanup PR can rename it; tracked in "Out of scope" below.

## Behavior matrix

| `req.Orgs` entry X is… | Candidates returned | Name resolved at read-time |
|---|---|---|
| A sectId only | All users with `sectId == X` | `sectName` |
| A deptId only | All users with `deptId == X` | `deptName` |
| Both (per domain assumption) | Union dedup'd by `account` — since dept ⊇ sect, this equals all users with `deptId == X` | `deptName` (prefer-dept wins) |
| Neither (unknown) | 0 candidates | — (no row written) |

## Callers / paths touched by Part 2

- `pkg/model/user.go` — new fields.
- `pkg/pipelines/member.go` — `$or` extended; applies to both `GetNewMembersPipeline` and the new `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` from Part 1.
- `room-service/store_mongo.go:451-472, 475-489` — enrichment join + display fold (dept-preference, new TCName field).
- `room-service/store_mongo.go:707` — `ListOrgMembers` `$or` over `(sectId, deptId)` so the `orgs.{orgId}.members` RPC resolves deptId-added orgs.
- `room-worker/store.go` — `OrgMemberStatus` struct extended.
- `room-worker/store_mongo.go:261-294` — `GetOrgMembersWithIndividualStatus` pipeline extended.
- `room-worker/handler.go:508-523` — name-harvest loop with dept-first preference.
- `room-worker/handler.go:618-622` — `MemberRemoved.SectName` is populated with the combined `displayOrg(name, tcName, orgID)` string instead of a raw sectName.
- `room-service/store_mongo.go:63-71` (`EnsureIndexes`) — new composite index `(deptId, account)` on `users` to match the existing `(sectId, account)` index, so the extended `$or` predicate is index-covered on both branches.

No changes needed to:
- `room-service/handler.go` `classifyAndValidate` or `handleAddMembers` — `Orgs` field shape is unchanged.
- `room_members` collection schema — `member.type` stays `"org"`; `member.id` stays the raw orgId string.
- Cross-site `MemberAddEvent` (carries accounts only).
- OIDC claim parsing — `users` doc population is external to this repo.

## Testing (Part 2)

**Unit — pipeline (`pkg/pipelines/member_test.go`)**:
- New `GetNewMembersPipeline` test cases: orgId matching only a sectId, orgId matching only a deptId, orgId matching both (verify dedup).
- Same matrix for `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline`.

**Unit — room-service enrichment (`room-service/store_mongo_test.go` or via handler test)**:
- Room with `member.id=X` and one user `(sectId=X, sectName="Sec")` → enriched `sectName == "Sec"`, no TCName.
- Room with `member.id=X` and one user `(deptId=X, deptName="Dep", deptTCName="部门")` → enriched `sectName == "Dep"`, `sectTCName == "部门"`.
- Room with `member.id=X` and overlap (one user `sectId=X`, one user `deptId=X`) → dept wins, `memberCount == 2`.

**Unit — room-worker (`room-worker/handler_test.go`)**:
- `processRemoveOrg` with all users `sectId=orgID`: sys-msg `SectName` is sect's name, `SectTCName` is sect's TC name.
- `processRemoveOrg` with all users `deptId=orgID`: sys-msg `SectName` is dept's name, `SectTCName` is dept's TC name.
- `processRemoveOrg` with mixed (one dept-matched user, one sect-only): sys-msg uses dept's `(name, tcName)`.
- `processRemoveOrg` with every name empty: sys-msg `Content` and `SectName` fall back to `req.OrgID` (no error), a warning is logged.
- `processRemoveOrg` with only `tcName` populated (no `name`): sys-msg uses `tcName` alone (no leading space).
- Enrichment: room with an org member whose users have no `name`/`tcName` at all → `display.sectName` resolves to `member.id`.

**Integration**:
- Seed users where `users[0].sectId="X"` and `users[1].deptId="X"`.
- `member.add` with `Orgs: ["X"]` → both users get subscriptions.
- `member.remove` org-flow on X → sys-msg carries dept's name.

## Performance and indexes

Every new or modified query is verified against the existing indexes; nothing is left to a full-collection scan. The table below covers all read paths introduced or modified across Parts 1 and 2.

| Pipeline / query | Filter | Index used | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GetCapacityCheckPipeline` `$match` | `sectId IN orgs OR deptId IN orgs OR account IN directAccounts` | `(sectId, account)` + new `(deptId, account)` + `account` | $or with both branches index-covered; MongoDB executes an index union. |
| `GetCapacityCheckPipeline` `$lookup subscriptions` | `roomId == X && u.account == Y` | existing unique `(roomId, u.account)` | Index-covered. |
| `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` `$match` | same as above | same as above | Same. |
| `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` `$lookup subscriptions` | same as above | same as above | Same. |
| `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` `$lookup room_members` | `rid == X && member.type == "individual" && member.id == $$uid` | existing unique `(rid, member.type, member.id)` | Index-covered. Critical: uses `member.id` (user's `_id`), not `member.account`. |
| `GetOrgMembersWithIndividualStatus` `$match` | `sectId == orgID OR deptId == orgID` | `(sectId, account)` + new `(deptId, account)` | Both branches index-covered; same index union as above. |
| `GetOrgMembersWithIndividualStatus` `$lookup room_members` | `rid == X && member.type == "individual" && member.id == $$uid` | existing unique `(rid, member.type, member.id)` | Index-covered. Switched from `member.account` to `member.id` as part of this work. |
| Enrichment `_orgMatch` `$lookup` (`room-service/store_mongo.go:451-472`) | `member.type == "org" && (sectId == $$orgId OR deptId == $$orgId)` | `(sectId, account)` + new `(deptId, account)` | $or both branches indexed; inner `$sort _isDept desc` + `$group $first` work on a small per-org candidate set (members of one org), not the whole users collection. |
| `ListOrgMembers.Find` (`room-service/store_mongo.go:707`) | `sectId == orgID OR deptId == orgID` | `(sectId, account)` + new `(deptId, account)` | $or both branches index-covered; sorted by `account` ASC matches the leading prefix of both compound indexes after the equality on the leading key. |

### Required new index

`room-service/store_mongo.go` `EnsureIndexes`:

```go
if _, err := s.users.Indexes().CreateOne(ctx, mongo.IndexModel{
    Keys: bson.D{{Key: "deptId", Value: 1}, {Key: "account", Value: 1}},
}); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("ensure users (deptId,account) index: %w", err)
}
```

Mirrors the existing `(sectId, account)` index. Created in `EnsureIndexes` at service startup; idempotent.

### Hot-path cost analysis

- **`member.add` request** triggers two pipeline executions: `CountNewMembers` (room-service) and `ListAddMemberCandidates` (room-worker). The split design ensures the capacity-check path doesn't pay for the `room_members` lookup. Both are gated by the `users` `$match` filter so they only touch the candidate set (typically tens of users for a direct add, hundreds for an org add), not the whole `users` collection.
- **`member.list` enrichment** (`ListRoomMembers` with `enrich=true`) is the most frequent hot path. Added work per org row: an extra `$or` branch in the inner `$lookup` `$match` (negligible — still indexed), plus per-org `$addFields` / `$sort` / `$group` / `$switch` stages operating on a small in-memory result set. For a room with N org rows the marginal cost stays O(N) rather than O(N × users).
- **`member.remove` (org)** triggers one `GetOrgMembersWithIndividualStatus` pipeline. The room_members lookup switching from `member.account` to `member.id` removes a quadratic-in-room-size scan that was a latent slow-query risk in the current code — net performance improvement over today's behavior, not just a no-regression.

### Pipeline complexity audit

The new `GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` runs **4 stages per candidate** (`$match` → 2× `$lookup` → `$project`), the same operator count as the existing `GetNewMembersPipeline` for the non-empty-roomID case. No N+1 patterns; no per-row Go-side queries.

The enrichment `_orgMatch` inner pipeline grows from **3 stages** (`$match` → `$group` → existing `$arrayElemAt`) to **6 stages** (`$match` → `$addFields` → `$sort` → `$group` → `$addFields display` → outer `$let` with `$cond`). Each runs on the small per-org candidate set, so absolute time stays in the low-millisecond range for typical rooms.

## Out of scope (Part 2)

- **Backfilling existing User docs** with dept fields. Handled by the external HR/directory sync.
- **OIDC claim extension** for `SectID`/`SectName`/`SectTCName`/`DeptTCName`. The current OIDC claim set only includes `DeptID`/`DeptName`, but `users` doc population doesn't go through OIDC anyway.
- **Wire-schema rename** of `MemberRemoved.SectName` → `OrgName` (and `display.sectName` → `display.orgName`). Tracked as a follow-up cleanup; the field name semantics drift but the wire stays stable for this PR.
- **Frontend rendering** of `SectTCName` / TCName variants in the member list and system messages. Backend exposes the fields; frontend uptake is separate.
- **Persistence of resolved name in `room_members`**. The room_members row keeps `member.id` only; the name is resolved on every read. This matches the existing pattern and the user's explicit "`RoomMember` will remain the same. No change there." constraint.

# Part 3 — Frontend: Navigate Directly On DM-Already-Exists Reply

## Problem

When a user starts a DM with someone they already have a DM with, `CreateRoomDialog` occasionally shows the "Room creation is taking longer than expected. If it succeeds, the room will appear in your sidebar shortly — you can dismiss this dialog." banner before navigating, instead of opening the existing room immediately.

The backend dedup is correct (`room-service/handler.go:272-278` returns `dmExistsError`; `replyDMExists` synchronously replies `{error: "dm already exists", roomId: "<existing>"}`). The frontend's `treatAsSuccess: isDMExistsReply` correctly short-circuits the async-result wait. The remaining gap is in the dialog's post-reply logic.

## Root cause

`CreateRoomDialog.jsx:87-105` treats both branches — genuine create and dedup — through the same flow:

1. Call `createRoom(...)`, get back `sync` (either `{status:"accepted",roomId,roomType}` or `{error:"dm already exists",roomId}`).
2. `setPendingRoom({id: roomId, ...})` — enters the wait-for-summaries state.
3. `useEffect` (`:41-47`) watches `summaries` for a row with id matching `pendingRoom.id`. On match → `onCreated(pendingRoom); onClose()`.
4. `useEffect` (`:61-70`) fires a 3-second timeout (`SUBSCRIPTION_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`); on expiry → sets the "taking longer than expected" error.

For a genuine create that's the correct shape — the room doesn't exist in `summaries` yet, and `subscription.update` will land shortly and dispatch `ROOM_ADDED`, populating `summaries`. The match effect fires and the dialog closes.

For the **dedup branch**, the room and subscription already exist. `summaries` should already contain the row from session start (`BUCKETS_LOADED`). In practice the match effect fires the same render tick and the dialog closes immediately — most users never see the banner. But the path is **brittle to any race** where `summaries` doesn't yet have that DM:

- User opens Create dialog before `BUCKETS_LOADED` resolves.
- Reconnect-rebuild of summaries races with the click.
- Future regressions to `useRoomSubscriptions` initial-load timing.

In those cases the 3-second timer wins and the user sees the banner for a room that already exists in their database.

## Design

Short-circuit the wait state on the dedup branch. The existing DM is guaranteed to exist server-side (the backend just confirmed it). The user's `subscriptions` and `summaries` will reflect it — and if they don't yet, they will momentarily; either way navigating directly to it is correct.

### Code change

`chat-frontend/src/components/MainApp/Sidebar/CreateRoomDialog/CreateRoomDialog.jsx`, `handleSubmit`:

```jsx
const { sync } = await createRoom(
    nats,
    { name: trimmedName, users: finalUsers, orgs: finalOrgs, channels: finalChannels },
    { treatAsSuccess: isDMExistsReply }
)
const roomId = sync.roomId
const displayName = trimmedName || finalUsers[0] || ''

if (isDMExistsReply(sync)) {
    // Dedup branch: server already confirmed the DM; skip the summaries-wait that can trip the 3s banner on a BUCKETS_LOADED race.
    onCreated({ id: roomId, type: 'dm', siteId: user.siteId, name: displayName })
    onClose()
    return
}

const roomType = sync.roomType
setPendingRoom({ id: roomId, type: roomType, siteId: user.siteId, name: displayName })
```

The post-dedup branch:
- Drops the `pendingRoom` setter (no wait state needed).
- Drops the `roomType` fallback (`sync.roomType || (isDMExistsReply(sync) ? 'dm' : undefined)`) since the only path that hits this case is `isDMExistsReply==true` and we hardcode `'dm'`. Note: this collapses the dedup-only-knows-roomId-not-type concern into "we always say `'dm'` on dedup." If the existing room is actually a `botDM`, the receiver (`ChatPage` / sidebar) will correct the type from the canonical subscription record. The DM/botDM distinction in the dialog's local `pendingRoom` is only used as a hint for the wait-state UI, which we're skipping.

### Why not also fix this for channels?

The dedup path only fires for DMs/botDMs (deterministic room IDs). Channels always get a fresh random ID per request and `room-service` never short-circuits — they always go through the async create path. So Part 3's logic is correctly scoped to the `isDMExistsReply(sync)` branch.

### `onCreated` contract

`onCreated({id, type, siteId, name})` is consumed by `Sidebar` / `MainApp` to set the active room. The shape here matches the genuine-create call exactly; the only behavior difference is that we don't enter the `pendingRoom` wait first. The downstream consumer doesn't care that no `ROOM_ADDED` will fire — it already has the room in summaries.

## Testing

`CreateRoomDialog.test.jsx`:
- **Existing test** at `:139` passes today because `DEFAULT_SUMMARIES` (`:23-27`) already contains `{id: 'r-existing'}`, so the wait-for-summaries effect matches on the first render. Rewrite the test to render with `summaries: []` (override the default) so it would deadlock on `SUBSCRIPTION_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS` under the pre-Part-3 code (failing the Red phase) and pass under Part 3's synchronous-navigate branch (Green).
- **New test** — same `summaries: []` setup, additionally assert the "taking longer than expected" banner is **never** rendered (`queryByText` returns `null`, no fake timers needed since the dedup branch skips the timeout entirely).

No backend tests change. Backend dedup behavior is unchanged.

## Out of scope (Part 3)

- **Channel/botDM dedup** — channels never dedup at room-service today; the backend would have to detect e.g. duplicate channel names per requester, which is a different feature.
- **Refactor of the `pendingRoom` wait machinery** — the wait state is still correct for the genuine-create branch. We're skipping it on the dedup branch, not removing it.
- **Frontend type-correction on dedup** — if a user creates what they think is a botDM but the dedup reply points at an existing regular DM (or vice versa), the dialog hardcodes `'dm'`. The canonical subscription record corrects this downstream. A more thoughtful "preserve sync.roomType when provided" tweak is plausible but the backend doesn't return `roomType` on the dedup reply today, so it's a backend-coupled improvement deferred to a follow-up.

# Part 4 — Remove `Room.CreatedBy` and rework the replay-equivalence check

## Problem

`Room.CreatedBy` is persisted (`bson:"createdBy"`), on the wire (`json:"createdBy"`), and surfaced in `chat-frontend/src/api/types.ts:110`. The frontend never reads it (the only write site is `fetchSidebarBuckets/index.ts:135`, which writes `""`). It IS used in `room-worker/handler.go` replay-equivalence checks at `:1141-1147` (async create) and `:1543-1551` (sync DM create) as one of four immutable identity fields compared after a duplicate-key on `CreateRoom`.

The check is over-determined and incidentally breaks DM concurrent-creation. When users A and B simultaneously hit "Create DM" with each other (race past room-service's `FindDMSubscription` dedup), both workers compute the same deterministic room ID via `BuildDMRoomID`. Whichever wins the insert sets `CreatedBy = winnerID`; the loser hits duplicate-key, fetches the existing room, and the equivalence check fails with "room ID collision" because `existing.CreatedBy != room.CreatedBy` — even though the room IS the intended DM, just created a millisecond earlier by the counterpart.

## Design

Drop the field everywhere it appears (model, wire, frontend type, frontend write site, docs). Replace the comparison with a requester-subscription check that's strictly more correct.

### Worker rewrite

Both `processCreateRoom` (`:1130-1153`) and the sync-DM path (`:1535-1558`) call a new private helper to avoid duplicating the recovery logic:

```go
// reconcileRoomOnDuplicateKey verifies the existing room is structurally compatible and the requester is a member; one source of truth for both create paths.
func (h *Handler) reconcileRoomOnDuplicateKey(ctx context.Context, want *model.Room, requesterAccount string) (*model.Room, error) {
	existing, err := h.store.GetRoom(ctx, want.ID)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("fetch on duplicate-key: %w", err)
	}
	if existing.Type != want.Type || existing.SiteID != want.SiteID {
		return nil, newPermanent("room ID collision (existing type=%s site=%s; want %s/%s)",
			existing.Type, existing.SiteID, want.Type, want.SiteID)
	}
	if _, err := h.store.GetSubscription(ctx, requesterAccount, want.ID); err != nil {
		if errors.Is(err, model.ErrSubscriptionNotFound) {
			return nil, newPermanent("room ID collision (requester %s not a member of existing room %s)",
				requesterAccount, want.ID)
		}
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("check requester sub on duplicate-key: %w", err)
	}
	return existing, nil
}
```

Each call site collapses to:

```go
if err := h.store.CreateRoom(ctx, room); err != nil {
	if !mongo.IsDuplicateKeyError(err) {
		return fmt.Errorf("create room: %w", err)
	}
	existing, err := h.reconcileRoomOnDuplicateKey(ctx, room, requester.Account)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	room = existing
}
```

The sync-DM path additionally preserves `acceptedAt = existing.CreatedAt` after the assignment — that's the only divergence and stays at the caller.

The `Name` comparison drops — it was load-bearing only as another identity check; the new `(Type, SiteID, requester-sub-exists)` triple is strictly more correct and decouples the equivalence check from future name-mutation flows.

### Removal sites

- `pkg/model/room.go` — drop `CreatedBy` field.
- `room-worker/handler.go` — remove `CreatedBy: requester.ID` from both `room := &model.Room{…}` literals; rewrite the duplicate-key blocks as above.
- `chat-frontend/src/api/types.ts:110` — drop `createdBy: string` from the `Room` type.
- `chat-frontend/src/api/fetchSidebarBuckets/index.ts:135` — drop the `createdBy: ''` write.
- `docs/client-api.md` — remove the row + example occurrences.

### Testing

Add an integration test for the previously-broken DM concurrent-create case in `room-worker/integration_test.go`: pre-insert a room with two pre-existing subs (counterpart already raced to create), then run `processCreateRoom` for the requester's request. Assert: no error, no duplicate sub, no duplicate room.

# Part 5 — Remove `target_user` Cassandra column

## Problem

`target_user FROZEN<"Participant">` exists in four Cassandra tables (`messages_by_room`, `messages_by_id`, `thread_messages_by_room`, `pinned_messages_by_room`) and as `Message.TargetUser *Participant` in `pkg/model/cassandra/message.go:81`. It's read by history-service via `baseColumns` in `internal/cassrepo/{messages_by_room,thread_messages}.go`. It's documented in `docs/client-api.md:939` and `docs/cassandra_message_model.md`.

**It is never written.** Greppable: `grep -rn "TargetUser:" /home/user/chat/` outside the struct declaration yields zero hits. All reads return NULL.

## Design

Remove the column and all references:
- `pkg/model/cassandra/message.go` — drop `TargetUser` field.
- `docker-local/cassandra/init/10-table-messages_by_room.cql`, `11-table-thread_messages_by_room.cql`, `12-table-pinned_messages_by_room.cql`, `13-table-messages_by_id.cql` — drop the column declaration.
- `history-service/internal/cassrepo/messages_by_room.go` + `thread_messages.go` — remove `target_user` from `baseColumns`.
- `docs/cassandra_message_model.md` — the source-of-truth schema (4 sections).
- `docs/client-api.md:939` — drop the row.

Production schema migration (`ALTER TABLE … DROP target_user`) is owned by ops/IaC; the dev init scripts ship the new schema for fresh setups. Reads against existing production tables continue to work — gocql ignores columns not declared in the struct.

# Part 6 — Phantom Org / User Request-Time Validation

## Problem

Both `chat.user.{account}.request.room.{roomID}.{siteID}.member.add` and `chat.user.{account}.request.rooms.create` (channel branch) accepted requests carrying org IDs or account names with no backing user document. The candidates aggregation (`GetAddMemberCandidatesPipeline` / `GetNewMembersPipeline`) is a join on `users`, so phantom inputs silently produced an empty candidate set — `CountNewMembers` returned 0 for those entries, the request published to the canonical stream, and the room-worker's `req.Orgs` loop (`room-worker/handler.go:891-898` and `:1319-1325`) wrote a `room_members` row plus fired a `members_added` system message for an org with zero backing users. Phantom user accounts were silently dropped at the candidates pipeline; the async-job reply still reported `success: true`.

## Design

Reject at the room-service request boundary so the synchronous RPC reply carries the error and nothing reaches the canonical stream. Two new store methods on `RoomStore`:

- `FindExistingOrgIDs(ctx, orgIDs []string) ([]string, error)` — returns the subset of `orgIDs` that match at least one user via `sectId` or `deptId`. Two parallel `Distinct` calls — one on each indexed field — keep the result bounded by `len(orgIDs)` and ride the existing `(sectId, account)` / `(deptId, account)` compound indexes.
- `FindExistingAccounts(ctx, accounts []string) ([]string, error)` — returns the subset of `accounts` that have a matching user document. Single `Distinct` on the indexed `account` field.

Both methods no-op (return `nil, nil`) on empty input, so the round trip is skipped when the request carries only the other dimension.

Two handler helpers (`validateOrgIDs`, `validateAccountsExist` in `room-service/handler.go`) call into the store and return wrapped sentinels:

- `validateOrgIDs` → `errInvalidOrg` (already in `sanitizeError`'s allow-list).
- `validateAccountsExist` → `errUserNotFound` (already in the allow-list).

The wrap includes the offending id (`fmt.Errorf("org %q: %w", id, errInvalidOrg)`) so logs identify the missing entry; the wire envelope still sanitizes down to the sentinel's `Error()`.

Both helpers are called immediately after the dedup step in `handleAddMembers` (after channel-ref expansion) and `handleCreateRoomChannel`, before `CountNewMembers` and `publishToStream`. Capacity / restricted-channel / bot-rejection checks remain ahead of these (cheaper, no DB call).

## Why the gate lives at the room-service boundary

The room-worker can't return a synchronous error to the client — by the time it sees the event, the room-service has already replied `accepted`. Async-job results (`chat.user.{requesterAccount}.response.{requestID}`) deliver the error, but only when the client opted in by setting `X-Request-ID` and only after the worker reaches the validation point. Pushing the check upstream gives every client an immediate, in-line error envelope and prevents the worker from ever writing the bogus `room_members` row.

## Callers / paths touched

- `room-service/store.go` — two new interface methods, generated mock regenerated.
- `room-service/store_mongo.go` — `Distinct`-based implementations.
- `room-service/handler.go` — `validateOrgIDs` + `validateAccountsExist` helpers, called from `handleAddMembers:709` and `handleCreateRoomChannel:296` after `allOrgs`/`allUsers` dedup.
- `docs/client-api.md` — Add Members and Create Room error-response sections updated to document `"invalid org"` and `"user not found"` synchronous rejections.

## Testing

Unit (`room-service/handler_test.go`):
- `TestHandler_AddMembers_PhantomOrgRejected` — single phantom org, no publish, `errInvalidOrg`.
- `TestHandler_AddMembers_PartiallyInvalidOrgRejected` — mixed valid + phantom; the whole request rejects.
- `TestHandler_AddMembers_NoOrgsSkipsOrgValidation` — gomock fails if `FindExistingOrgIDs` is called for a users-only request.
- `TestHandler_AddMembers_PhantomUserRejected` — `errUserNotFound`.
- `TestHandler_AddMembers_NoUsersSkipsUserValidation` — symmetric guard against the unnecessary round trip.
- 12 existing happy-path tests gain an `expectAllAccountsExist(store)` helper expectation so the validation gate is satisfied.

Integration (`room-service/integration_test.go`):
- `TestMongoStore_FindExistingOrgIDs_Integration` — sectId + deptId set union, all-phantom, empty-input, dept-only invariant.
- `TestMongoStore_FindExistingAccounts_Integration` — matching subset, all-phantom, empty-input.

## Out of scope

- Worker-side defense-in-depth (a second validation pass in `room-worker` once the event arrives). The single request-time gate is sufficient; the worker trusts validated canonical events, as it does everywhere else.
- Org/user existence checks for the `Channels` ref (cross-site bulk-source). Channel expansion already pulls members from `room_members`, which can only carry rows for users that previously existed. The validation gate runs on the resulting `allUsers` set anyway, so a malformed remote source would still surface as `errUserNotFound`.
- Cross-site federation behavior: an account that exists on a remote site but not locally will reject with `errUserNotFound`. This is intentional under the current single-site `users` collection model; multi-site user replication is a separate problem.

# Part 7 — PR #171 (room-encryption-keys) Follow-up Findings

Three review threads left unresolved on PR #171 after merge. The PR is on `main` now (this branch rebased onto it), so the follow-ups land here.

## Finding 1 — `shouldRotate` guard at `room-worker/handler.go:319`

**Reviewer comment (`@mliu33`):**

> I actually can't think of the case where this might happen. Because Jetstream will not redeliver unless you nak, and once the message is delivered, only one pod will receive the message. Therefore, current version will always be less than or equal to req.BaseKeyVersion because if a prior redelivery already rotates the key, there won't be another redelivery happening. If there is no such case, we should remove this check and also the one in room-service to reduce redundant valkey db call.

**Decision: keep both guards. Tighten the inline comment so the failure mode is obvious to future readers.**

**Reply to post on the thread:**

> The "no second redelivery after rotate" premise holds only if every step after rotate either succeeds or is NAK-safe. In `processRemoveIndividual` there are three NAK sites that fire *after* `rotateAndFanOut` returns: `GetUser` for non-self-leave (`handler.go:470`), the sys-msg publish (`handler.go:514`), and the cross-site outbox publish (`handler.go:530`). Same shape in `processRemoveOrg`.
>
> When one of those NAKs, redelivery is real. Without the guard, delivery 2 calls `roomkeystore.GenerateKeyPair()` — fresh random bytes K2 — and fans them out to survivors. If any survivor is briefly offline for that second fanout (NATS gap, mobile sleep, brief WS disconnect), they're stranded on K1 while Valkey holds K2 and `broadcast-worker` encrypts under K2. They can't decrypt new messages until something forces a key recovery.

**Code change:** comment-only at `room-worker/handler.go:319-320`. Max two lines.

## Finding 2 — `buildAndFanOutRoomKey` re-fetches the key at `room-worker/handler.go:1789`

**Reviewer comment (`@mliu33`):**

> One optimization is to pass room key down so that buildAndFanout does not need to make db call to fetch again.

**Decision: accept, under a caller-owns-the-fetch contract.**

**Reply to post on the thread:**

> Good catch on the create path — `processCreateRoom` already has the pair in scope from the gate-Get at `handler.go:1188` and discards it before `buildAndFanOutRoomKey` re-fetches at `handler.go:1793`. Refactored `buildAndFanOutRoomKey` to take `*VersionedKeyPair` as a parameter and threaded it through `finishCreateRoom`. Saves one Valkey round trip per channel/DM create.

> The `processAddMembers` path doesn't have the pair in scope; rather than two ways to invoke (with/without pair) I kept the contract uniform — caller always fetches, function always receives. Net: −1 Valkey Get on create, 0 change on add. The nil check stays inside `buildAndFanOutRoomKey` as a defensive guard so a future caller bug surfaces as a permanent error instead of a panic.

**Why the caller-owns-fetch pattern is safe against concurrent rotation:**

The theoretical race is: create's gate-Get (sees v=0) → concurrent `member.remove` on the same room rotates Valkey to v=1 → create's fan-out runs with the stashed v=0. `member.remove` can only be authorized once the room exists in Mongo, which only happens after `processCreateRoom` commits the room insert, well past the gate-Get. Within a single `processCreateRoom` invocation the pair is stable.

**Code change:**

1. Change `buildAndFanOutRoomKey` signature to take `pair *roomkeystore.VersionedKeyPair`. Keep the nil check and the permanent-absent error path inside as a defensive guard.
2. Thread `pair` through `finishCreateRoom` (new parameter) and pass through from both `processCreateRoom` call sites.
3. `processAddMembers`: add a `keyStore.Get` immediately before the fan-out call (unchanged Valkey round-trip count for this path).
4. Update `TestBuildAndFanOutRoomKey_SendsToAllMembersIncludingRemoteSite` to pass the pair directly and drop the `keyStore.Get` expectation.

## Finding 3 — success counters at `room-worker/handler.go:347, 356, 362`

**Reviewer comment (`@mliu33`):**

> In my opinion, I think there is not much benefit to track success rotate/generate key metrics. It's good to track error count, but not so much for success count as adding metric also costs some cpu time.

**Decision: drop them. Counter `Add` is cheap, but the team's stated convention is errors-only and we follow it.**

**Reply to post on the thread:**

> Agreed — dropped `KeyGenerated` and `KeyRotated` at every emit site (`room-worker/handler.go:347, 356, 362` and `room-service/handler.go:369`) and removed the counter declarations + `init()` registrations from `pkg/roomkeymetrics/metrics.go`. Denominator for error-rate alerting can come from JetStream consumer ack rate or upstream remove/create handler counts. Error counters (`FanoutErrors`, `ValkeyErrors`, `KeyAbsentErrors`) stay.

**Code change:** delete the four `KeyGenerated.Add` / `KeyRotated.Add` call sites and the two counter declarations + their `init()` registration blocks.
