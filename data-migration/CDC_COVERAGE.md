# Collections CDC — coverage matrix

> Companion to `README.md` (component overview) and `SOURCE_DATA.md` (source schema).
> This doc pins **exactly which source change events the collections migration covers, and which it does not** — the reference for the team building the `oplog-collections-transformer`.
> Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-oplog-transformer-collections-design.md`.
>
> Scope: the **live CDC tail** of the operational collections (rooms, subscriptions, thread_subscriptions, users). The bulk/initial state sync ≤ checkpoint is a separate owner's job; we tail from the handed-off checkpoint.

## CDC payload facts (all collections)

The connector forwards raw change-stream events with **no `updateLookup`** and **no `fullDocumentBeforeChange`**:

| Op | Payload carried | Source lookup by `_id` |
|---|---|---|
| `insert` | full `fullDocument` | in payload |
| `replace` | full `fullDocument` | in payload (lookup not needed) |
| `update` | only `updateDescription` (changed fields, no post-image) | **full current doc** (doc still exists) |
| `delete` | only `documentKey._id` | **nothing** — doc already gone |

→ A source lookup resolves the full doc for any op **except `delete`**.

## Event coverage matrix

**Legend:** ✅ migrated · ❌ intentionally not migrated · ⚠️ deferred / later work.

| # | Source event | Op + payload | Source lookup (by `_id`) | Current-system facts | Handling / impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rooms** |
| 1 | Room create | `insert` — full doc | in payload | `t` ∈ `c,p,d,l,v`; `prid`⇒discussion; `teamId`/`teamMain`; `d` can have >2 users | ✅ map → `room_sync` (skip `l`,`v`,group-DM) |
| 2 | Room replace | `replace` — full doc | not needed | whole-doc rewrite; can cross type/exclusion boundary | ✅ re-classify → `room_sync` |
| 3 | Room change | `update` — changed fields only | full current doc | — | ✅ re-read doc → `room_renamed` / `room_restricted` / `room_sync` |
| 4 | Room delete | `delete` — `_id` only | nothing — doc gone | app has no room-delete operation | ❌ skip (no app deletion; un-actionable) |
| **Subscriptions** |
| 5 | Sub create | `insert` — full doc | in payload | `u`, `rid`, `roles[]`, `open`, `f`, `disableNotifications`, `ls`/`lr`, `alert` | ✅ `member_added` + state events |
| 6 | Sub replace | `replace` — full doc | not needed | whole-doc rewrite | ✅ re-classify → `member_added` + state |
| 7 | Sub change (incl. leave/rejoin) | `update` — changed fields only | full current doc | leaving sets `open:false` (not a row delete) | ✅ re-read doc → `open`-toggle → `member_added`/`member_removed`; mute/fav/role/read → matching event |
| 8 | Sub delete (true row removal) | `delete` — `_id` only | nothing — doc gone | destination subs key by generated `UUIDv7`, not source `_id`; removal needs `(roomID, account)` | ❌ skip (un-actionable; rare — leave is `open:false`) |
| **Thread subscriptions** |
| 9 | Follow / first reply | `insert` — full doc | in payload | keyed `(u._id, parentMessage._id)`; carries `rid`, `lastSeenAt`, `unreadMention` | ✅ resolve thread-room+user → `thread_subscription_upserted` |
| 10 | Thread-sub replace | `replace` — full doc | not needed | whole-doc rewrite | ✅ re-resolve → upsert |
| 11 | Thread read / mention change | `update` — changed fields only | full current doc | — | ✅ re-read doc → re-upsert |
| 12 | Thread unfollow | `delete` — `_id` only | nothing — doc gone | destination thread-subs key by `(threadRoomId, userId)`; inbox-worker has no thread-sub removal handler; live stack emits no thread-unfollow federation event | ❌ skip (un-actionable **and** no handler) → stale follow lingers |
| **Users** |
| 13 | User create | `insert` — full doc | in payload | `_id`, `username` (mutable), `type`, `customFields.*`, `roles[]`, `federation.origin` | ✅ insert-if-absent by account |
| 14 | User replace | `replace` — full doc | not needed | whole-doc rewrite | ✅ insert-if-absent (re-classify) |
| 15 | User profile change (after first seed) | `update` — changed fields only | full current doc | company-wide user sync owns the record; insert-if-absent leaves existing untouched | ❌ not propagated (other sync keeps it current) |
| 16 | User deactivate / delete | `update` (`active:false`) or `delete` | `update`: full doc · `delete`: nothing | source sets `active:false` (no row deletion); no destination apply-path wired | ❌ deferred (out of scope) |
| **All collections** |
| 17 | Collection drop / rename | collection-level (`drop`/`rename`/`invalidate`) | n/a | terminates/invalidates the per-collection change stream | ⚠️ out of scope, deferred — connector re-point, not migration logic |

## inbox-worker handler coverage

Every apply-handler the inbox-worker exposes is either produced by the migration or intentionally not:

| Inbox handler | Emitted? | From |
|---|---|---|
| `member_added` | ✅ | sub `insert`/`replace`; `open` false→true |
| `member_removed` | ✅ | sub `open` true→false |
| `room_sync` | ✅ | room `insert`/`replace`/other-field `update` |
| `role_updated` | ✅ | sub `roles[]` |
| `subscription_read` | ✅ | sub `max(ls,lr)` + `alert` |
| `subscription_mute_toggled` | ✅ | sub `disableNotifications` |
| `subscription_favorite_toggled` | ✅ | sub `f` |
| `thread_subscription_upserted` | ✅ | thread-sub `insert`/`replace`/`update` |
| `room_renamed` | ✅ | room `name`/`fname` change |
| `room_restricted` | ✅ | room `restricted`/`externalAccess` change |
| `thread_read` | ⚠️ not emitted | redundant — thread-sub `lastSeenAt` rides `thread_subscription_upserted`; `Subscription.ThreadUnread` is message-pipeline-owned |

## Open confirmations (source engineers)

- Which room field(s) back **`Restricted`** (read-only) and **`ExternalAccess`** — see `SOURCE_DATA.md`.
- Does the source emit whole-doc **`replace`** for these collections, or only field-level `update`? (If never, rows 2/6/10/14 are moot.)
- Where does a user **employee id** live (if at all).
