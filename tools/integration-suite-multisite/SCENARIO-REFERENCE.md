# Test scenario YAML — reference (multi-site)

How a multi-site scenario YAML is shaped, what each field means, what
tokens you can use inside it, and what the loader accepts or rejects.

This is a reference, not a workflow guide. For the workflow see
[AUTHORING.md](AUTHORING.md). For the infrastructure that scenarios
reference (verbs, readers, matchers, seed-effects), see the YAMLs
under `catalogs/` — each file is heavily commented.

**Authoritative schema:** `internal/scenario/types.go`. When this doc
disagrees with that file, the Go type wins — that is a doc bug.

The multi-site shape is **fundamentally different** from the single-site
shape. The key differences are:

- No `cases:` array.
- No `base_input:`.
- No top-level `seed:` — seed is nested under `sites.<site>.seed`.
- `tag:` is at scenario level, not per-case.
- `site:` is required on `input` and on every site-scoped
  `expected[i]`.
- `site:` is forbidden on `reply` and `cassandra_select` entries.

## 1. Where scenarios live

```
scenarios/
├── drafts/                     unreviewed; informational in CI
│   ├── <name>.yaml
│   └── <group>/<name>.yaml     subdirectories permitted (any depth)
└── approved/                   promoted via human PR; gates the run
    ├── <name>.yaml
    └── <group>/<name>.yaml
```

One scenario per file. Discovery walks both trees recursively, so
authors are free to group by service (`messages/`, `rooms/`), by
phase (`infra-sanity/`, `federation/`), or not at all. CI scoring
keys off the `status: approved` field, never the directory.

**Uniqueness rule.** The `scenario:` field is the perf-history key
in `docs/integration-suite-multisite/performance.json` and the
identity used by the menu / reporter. Two scenarios with the same
`scenario:` field — even in different subdirectories — is a hard
loader error at validate and runner startup. Filenames may collide
across subdirs (they're just paths); `scenario:` names cannot.

The filename (without `.yaml`) should still match the `scenario:`
field by convention — it makes `vi`-from-failure-report straight-
forward and keeps cross-references discoverable.

**`pre_fire_scripts:` resolution is unchanged** by nesting. Paths
resolve relative to the YAML's directory (see §4.5) — co-located
scripts continue to work at any depth.

---

## 2. Top-level scenario shape

Every field the loader recognizes:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `scenario` | string | yes | — | Human-readable name; appears in reports and perf keys. |
| `source` | string | yes | — | Design doc or file:line citation. Authors do not invent expectations. |
| `status` | string | no | `draft` | `draft` or `approved`. `approved` gates CI via the approved-only report. |
| `tag` | string | yes | — | `positive` or `negative`. Drives the confusion matrix. |
| `sites` | map | yes | — | Map of `site-a`/`site-b` → site spec. At least one site required. |
| `cassandra_data` | list | no | — | Top-level Cassandra seed rows. Cassandra is shared; do not put this under `sites`. |
| `pre_fire_scripts` | list of strings | no | — | Author-owned scripts that run after `Sandbox.Setup` and before `Dispatcher.Fire`. See §4.5. |
| `input` | object | yes | — | The single verb fire. |
| `expected` | list | yes | — | Non-empty list of assertions. |

A minimal valid scenario:

```yaml
scenario: Room Creates on Site A
source: room-service/handler.go:300
tag: positive

sites:
  site-a:
    seed:
      users:
        alice: { verified: true }

input:
  site: site-a
  verb: nats_request
  subject: chat.user.${alice.account}.request.room.site-a.create
  payload:
    name: Lobby
    users: ["${alice.account}"]
  credential: ${alice.credential}

expected:
  - location: reply
    match:
      body_json:
        status: accepted
```

---

## 3. `sites` map shape

```yaml
sites:
  site-a:            # must be "site-a" or "site-b" — no other values
    seed:
      users: ...
      rooms: ...         # optional
      memberships: ...   # optional
  site-b:
    seed:
      users: ...
```

Exactly two site keys are supported: `site-a` and `site-b`. Any other
key is a loader error. A site may be omitted entirely if no seed is
needed for it (e.g. a single-site baseline).

### 3.1 Seed — users

```yaml
seed:
  users:
    <alias>:
      <effect-flag>: <bool>
```

- `<alias>` is a scenario-local handle. Substitution tokens
  `${<alias>.account}`, `${<alias>.id}`, `${<alias>.jwt}`,
  `${<alias>.nkey}`, `${<alias>.credential}` resolve to the
  materialized user's fields.
- `<effect-flag>` is a key from `catalogs/seed-effects/` (closed
  catalog). Unknown flags fail validation before any I/O.
- Effect flags with value `false` are explicit no-ops.
- The user's ID is derived: `id = "u-" + account`.
- Users are registered against the specified site's auth-service; their
  credentials are only valid on that site.

**Seed-effects catalog (today):**

| Flag | Effect | When |
|------|--------|------|
| `verified: true` | Mint nkey + JWT via auth-service /auth | Any actor that needs to make a NATS request |

`verified: false` (default; also explicit) leaves the user with empty
JWT/NkeySeed — for negative scenarios that assert NATS auth rejection.

### 3.2 Seed — rooms

```yaml
seed:
  rooms:
    - id: r-eng            # required; must be unique within scenario
      type: channel        # "channel" or "dm"
      name: Engineering    # required for channel; omit for dm
      user_count: 501      # optional; overrides the auto-derived count
      created_at: ${now - 1h}  # optional; defaults to now if omitted
```

Rooms are inserted into the site's Mongo `rooms` collection before the
fire. Closed enum for `type`. DM rooms are limited to two members (see
`docs/spec-room-subscription-seed.md`). `created_at` must be a
`${now ± duration}` token (same grammar as `cassandra_data`
timestamps — see §4); omitted → the room's `createdAt` is stamped at
seed time (sandbox open).

`user_count` defaults to the number of seeded memberships for the
room (mirrors what `room-worker` writes at create-room time). Set
explicitly when the scenario needs to trip the **large-room post
restriction** without actually seeding hundreds of members: the gate
in `message-gatekeeper/handler.go` reads `rooms.userCount` (cached
metadata) — so `user_count: 501` with two real members is the
canonical shape for exercising the cap.

### 3.3 Seed — memberships

```yaml
seed:
  memberships:
    alice:                  # user alias (must be declared in seed.users)
      - room: r-eng         # must reference a room in seed.rooms
        roles: [owner]      # list of "owner" / "admin" / "member"; defaults to [member]
    bob: [r-eng]            # shorthand: list of room IDs → all default to [member]
```

The grammar is `map[<user-alias>] → list of memberships`. Each
membership entry is either:
- An object `{room: <id>, roles: [<role>...]}` for explicit roles, or
- A bare room-ID string (no role list — defaults to `[member]`).

Both forms can coexist in one scenario (see
`scenarios/drafts/cross-site-room-rename-federation.yaml` for a
worked example using both shapes).

Memberships insert subscription rows into the site's Mongo
`subscriptions` collection.

---

## 4. `cassandra_data:` shape

```yaml
cassandra_data:
  - table: messages_by_room
    rows:
      - room_id: r-eng
        created_at: ${now - 2m}
        bucket: ${bucket(created_at)}
        message_id: m-1
        msg: "hello"
        site_id: site-a
```

This block is at scenario top level, not under any site. Cassandra is
a shared single-cluster deployment.

- `table` — CQL table name (must exist in the keyspace).
- `rows` — list of column→value maps. Column names must match the CQL
  schema exactly — for `messages_by_room` and `messages_by_id` the
  text body column is `msg` (NOT `body_text`); see
  `docs/cassandra_message_model.md` and
  `pkg/model/cassandra/message.go` for the full schema.
- `${now ± d}` — relative timestamp. Supported units: `ms`, `s`, `m`,
  `h`. Resolves to Unix milliseconds relative to `Sandbox.StartTime`.
- `${bucket(<col>)}` — auto-computes the message-bucket partition key
  from the resolved value of the named column (`created_at` in the
  example). Uses the same `MESSAGE_BUCKET_HOURS` window the services
  use.

---

## 4.4 `mongo_data:` shape

```yaml
mongo_data:
  - site: site-a
    collection: thread_rooms
    docs:
      - _id: tr-1
        roomId: r-shared
        parentMsgId: m-abc
        ownerAccount: ${alice.account}
        createdAt: ${now - 5m}
```

Site-scoped pre-population of sandbox-owned Mongo collections beyond
the three `seed.<site>.seed.{users,rooms,memberships}` shapes.
Typically used for thread/notification scenarios that need a
pre-existing `thread_rooms` or `thread_subscriptions` doc to address
by primary key from the verb fire.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `site` | yes | `site-a` or `site-b`. Must match a site declared under `sites:`. |
| `collection` | yes | Closed enum — see below. |
| `docs` | yes | List of documents to insert (each a plain map). |

**Closed-catalog collections.** A `mongo_data` entry MUST reference
a collection from the sandbox-owned set. Today:

```
users          rooms                 subscriptions
room_members   thread_rooms          thread_subscriptions
custom_emojis
```

If a scenario needs a collection that isn't here yet, extend the
catalog in `internal/runtime/sandbox_mongo_data.go`
(`mongoDataAllowedCollections`) and `internal/runtime/sandbox.go`
(`sandboxOwnedCollections`) together — the first is the seed
contract, the second is the drop contract. Both must agree or the
sandbox can't guarantee byte-identical state between runs.

**Substitution and tokens.** Inside each doc value:
- `${<alias>.<field>}` resolves like everywhere else — same Phase A
  pass as the input subject.
- `${now ± d}` resolves to a `time.Time` anchored at `Sandbox.StartTime`.
- Strings that aren't tokens pass through unchanged.

Recursion: substitution + now-token resolution walk into nested
maps and lists, so a sub-document like `parent: { senderId:
${alice.id}, createdAt: ${now - 1h} }` works without flattening.

**When to use `mongo_data` — and when NOT to use it**

`mongo_data` seeds **state that already exists before the fire under
test** — state the system genuinely would have produced earlier, in
some prior interaction the scenario isn't exercising. The classic
shape is "a pre-condition the fire reads from but doesn't write to":

  ✓ a subscription that `room-worker` created earlier (a fire is
    going to test the subscription-reading side of some other flow)
  ✓ a `thread_rooms` doc that a peer site's federation event is
    about to update (the fire under test is the federation handler,
    not the thread-creation that produced the doc)
  ✓ historical `notifications` rows for a "mark-as-read" verb's
    side-effect test

`mongo_data` is **NOT** a substitute for multi-fire. Specifically,
**do not fabricate the output of a fire you're skipping** in order
to test what would have come AFTER it. Example of the anti-pattern:
seeding `thread_rooms` + `thread_subscriptions` to simulate "the
first thread reply happened" so you can fire reply #2 and call it a
test of the subsequent-reply path.

That fails for a reason worth naming. The system's real
first-reply path produces a *specific* shape — UUIDv7
`thread_room._id`, exact `replyAccounts` contents, the parent's
`thread_room_id` stamp in Cassandra, the
`(threadRoomId, userAccount)` unique-index linkage. A hand-built
fixture either:

- diverges from that shape and produces a test that's green
  against state the system would never produce, or
- has to be kept in lockstep across `mongo_data` + `cassandra_data`
  by hand, which is fiddly and breaks subtly when the production
  shape evolves.

The legitimate path for subsequent-reply / dedup / redelivery /
multi-step scenarios is the DAG-of-tasks / multi-fire work in
`docs/integration-suite-plan-ahead.md` §2.3 (T2). Until that lands,
those scenarios stay blocked — `mongo_data` is not the workaround.

**Worked example — pre-existing subscription for a federation
arrival test:**

```yaml
sites:
  site-a:
    seed:
      users:
        alice: { verified: true }
      rooms:
        - id: r-eng
          name: Engineering
          type: channel
      memberships:
        alice: [r-eng]
  site-b:
    seed:
      users:
        bob: { verified: true }

# Pre-existing thread_rooms doc on site-b — modeling "bob already
# replied locally to m-parent earlier; the doc was created by
# message-worker-site-b at that prior moment." The scenario fires
# a cross-site event that inbox-worker-site-b will upsert AGAINST
# this existing doc — testing the federation-receive side, NOT
# the thread-creation side.
mongo_data:
  - site: site-b
    collection: thread_rooms
    docs:
      - _id: tr-existing
        roomId: r-eng
        parentMsgId: m-parent
        parentMsgCreatedAt: ${now - 1h}
        replyAccounts: ["${bob.account}"]
        createdAt: ${now - 1h}
```

The thread_rooms doc is genuine pre-existing state: bob's earlier
local reply would have created it. The scenario's fire (a federated
`thread_subscription_upserted` event arriving from site-a) is what
we're testing. `inbox-worker-site-b` upserting against the existing
doc — joining alice into `replyAccounts`, materializing a new
`thread_subscriptions` row — is the assertion target. No
fabrication of first-reply output; the system genuinely produces
this pre-state in production.

---

## 4.5 `pre_fire_scripts` — author-owned setup hooks

Some scenarios need pre-conditions that the seed grammar cannot
express — typically operationally-scaffolded state that lives outside
any service's bootstrap responsibility (per `ARCHITECTURE.md` §0,
"the tool's limits"). The `pre_fire_scripts` field lets the author
declare a list of executable scripts that the harness runs **after
`Sandbox.Setup` completes and before `Dispatcher.Fire`**.

```yaml
pre_fire_scripts:
  - prep-outbox-streams.sh
  - prep-vault-secret.sh
```

The grammar is intentionally minimal — a list of relative paths
(strings only; no `args:`, no nested config). Each script is the
author's bespoke tool for one job; if it needs values, it reads
env vars or just hard-codes.

| Property | Rule |
|----------|------|
| Path | Relative to the directory of the scenario YAML file. |
| Working directory | The directory of the scenario YAML file. |
| Execution order | List order. Single-threaded; the next script does not start until the previous one exits 0. |
| Exit code | Non-zero fails the scenario; remaining scripts do not run. |
| Failure reason | `pre_fire_scripts[i] "name.sh": exit status N; output: <stderr/stdout snippet, truncated at 4 KB>`. Surfaces in `last-run.md`. |
| Permissions | Script must be executable (`chmod +x`). The harness exec's it directly — shebang line picks the interpreter. |

### Environment variables exposed to the script

```
   ISM_SITE_A_NATS_URL      host-mapped NATS URL for site-a
   ISM_SITE_B_NATS_URL      host-mapped NATS URL for site-b
   ISM_NATS_CREDS_FILE      absolute path to backend.creds
   ISM_SITE_A_MONGO_URI     host-mapped Mongo URI for site-a
   ISM_SITE_B_MONGO_URI     host-mapped Mongo URI for site-b
   ISM_CASSANDRA_HOSTS      shared Cassandra host:port (single)
   ISM_RUN_ID               sandbox run identifier
   ISM_SCENARIO_NAME        the `scenario:` field of this YAML
```

The script also inherits the caller's `PATH`, `HOME`, and other
environment so CLI tools (`nats`, `mongosh`, `cqlsh`, etc.) the
operator already installed are discoverable.

### Worked example — pre-creating `OUTBOX_<site>`

`OUTBOX_<site>` is owned by ops/IaC in production and is not
bootstrapped by any chat service. If a scenario fires production code
that publishes to `outbox.<site>.>`, the publish returns `nats: no
response from stream`. That's a real finding; the harness will not
auto-fill the gap (per the limits doc). A scenario that wants to
test downstream effects past the gap can declare the prep as a
script the operator's own infrastructure runs.

```yaml
pre_fire_scripts:
  - prep-outbox-streams.sh
```

```sh
# prep-outbox-streams.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
for site in site-a site-b; do
  url_var="ISM_$(echo "$site" | tr 'a-z-' 'A-Z_')_NATS_URL"
  nats stream add "OUTBOX_$site" \
       --subjects "outbox.$site.>" \
       --server "${!url_var}" \
       --creds "$ISM_NATS_CREDS_FILE" \
       --defaults --no-progress
done
```

The script is the author's responsibility — its content, its
runtime dependencies, its cleanup, its idempotency. The harness's
role is purely to execute it and surface the result.

### What `pre_fire_scripts` is NOT

- Not a fallback for missing scenario state. Anything the seed grammar
  CAN express (users, rooms, memberships, remote_users, cassandra_data)
  belongs in the seed block — author-visible, declarative, no
  external dependency.
- Not a place to invoke production code on the author's behalf — if
  the scenario wants the app to do something, that's `input:`, not
  `pre_fire_scripts:`.
- Not a workaround for harness bugs — if a scenario shouldn't need
  a script, fix the harness or the scenario, not patch around it.

---

## 5. `input` shape

`input:` accepts EITHER a single fire (a map) OR a list of tasks fired
in declaration order. Both decode to the same internal task list.

**Single fire (map):**

```yaml
input:
  site: site-a        # required; "site-a" or "site-b"
  verb: nats_request  # required; from catalogs/verbs/
  subject: <template> # required; substitution tokens resolved
  payload: <map>      # required for nats_request; substitution resolved
  credential: <ref>   # required; ${<alias>.credential}
```

**Multi-fire (list of tasks):**

```yaml
input:
  - id: create        # required in list shape; unique; [a-z][a-z0-9_-]*
    site: site-a
    verb: nats_request
    subject: chat.user.${alice.account}.request.room.site-a.create
    payload: { name: Engineering }
    credential: ${alice.credential}
  - id: rename
    site: site-a
    verb: nats_request
    subject: chat.user.${alice.account}.request.room.${create.reply.body_json.roomId}.site-a.rename
    payload: { name: Renamed }
    credential: ${alice.credential}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| `id` | string | list shape only | Unique within the scenario. Names the task for `${id.reply.*}` substitution and `match.task: id` scoping. The single-fire map shape needs no id. |
| `site` | string | yes | `site-a` or `site-b`. Routes the fire to that site's NATS connection. |
| `verb` | string | yes | Must be in `catalogs/verbs/`. Today: `nats_request`, `jetstream_publish`. |
| `subject` | string | yes | NATS subject template. Tokens resolved before dispatch. |
| `payload` | map | yes | JSON payload. Tokens resolved. |
| `credential` | string | yes | `${<alias>.credential}`. The alias must be declared in `sites.<input.site>.seed.users`. |

Tasks fire **sequentially in declaration order**. There is no parallel
/ ordering grammar — that is a separate, deferred feature.

### 5.1 Reply substitution — `${<id>.reply.*}`

A later task (or any `expected[]` assertion) can reference an earlier
task's captured reply:

| Token | Resolves to |
|-------|-------------|
| `${<id>.reply.body_json.<field>}` | A field of the decoded JSON reply body (dot-walk for nesting). |
| `${<id>.reply.status}` | Sugar for `body_json.status`. |

Reply-only. Rules enforced at load time:

- The referenced `<id>` must be a task declared **earlier** in
  declaration order (forward / unknown references are rejected).
- Only `nats_request` tasks produce a reply. A `${<id>.reply.*}`
  reference to a `jetstream_publish` task (fire-and-forget, no reply)
  fails at fire time.

> **Async-job caveat.** Several RPCs (Create Room, Add Members, …) are
> async-job: the synchronous reply only confirms acceptance; the
> durable effect (room, subscriptions) is written later by a worker.
> Because tasks fire back-to-back with **no inter-task wait**, a task
> that acts on a resource another task just created may race the async
> write. Chain reply *data* that is valid immediately (e.g. a
> deterministic DM roomId); do not assume a created room is queryable
> by the next fire.

---

## 6. `expected[]` shape

Each element in the `expected` list is one assertion.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| `location` | string | yes | — | One of the six registered poller locations (see §7). |
| `site` | string | see §7 | — | Required or forbidden depending on `location`. |
| `args` | map | location-specific | — | Per-primitive args (see §7). |
| `match` | map | yes | — | Subset shape against the event payload. May carry the `task:` selector (reply only — see below). |
| `timeout` | duration | no | `5s` | Gomega `Eventually` timeout. Go duration strings. |
| `polling` | duration | no | `100ms` | How often the poller is re-invoked. |
| `not` | bool | no | `false` | `true` uses `Consistently(…).ShouldNot(…)`. |

The runner short-circuits on the first failing assertion.

### 6.1 `match.task:` selector (reply assertions only)

In a multi-fire scenario each `nats_request` task produces its own
reply event. To scope a `reply` assertion to one task, add a reserved
`task:` key inside `match:`:

```yaml
expected:
  - location: reply
    match: { task: create, body_json: { status: accepted } }
  - location: reply
    match: { task: rename, body_json: { status: accepted } }
```

- Valid **only** on `location: reply` — rejected at load time on any
  other location. A reply is captured synchronously while its task is
  firing, so it can be tagged unambiguously; background pollers observe
  state with no "active task", so DB/stream assertions disambiguate by
  **content** (the fields that already identify the row) instead.
- Unscoped reply `match:` (no `task:`) accepts any reply — the
  single-fire default.
- Forbidden nested inside `outbox_payload:`.

---

## 6.2 `flow:` shape (optional, opt-in)

When a scenario needs **a gate between fires** — wait for an
observation before firing the next task — add a top-level `flow:`
field that orders existing `input:` and `expected:` entries by id.
Without `flow:`, scenarios run as today (fires sequentially, then
flat `expected[]` evaluated against the accumulated buffer). With
`flow:`, the flow executor walks the ordering barrier-by-barrier;
observations positioned between fires are gates.

**When to add `flow:`:** you need to wait for X to land before
firing Y, or test a read-after-write contract. Otherwise leave it
out — legacy is fine for simple 1-fire/N-assert validation.

**Grammar:**

```
flow ::= group ( ">>" group )*
group ::= id | "[" id ( "," id )* "]"
```

- `>>` = sequential.
- `[a, b]` = parallel observation group (homogeneous; mixed
  fire+observe rejected; parallel-fire `[fire_a, fire_b]` reserved
  but rejected in v1 with "deferred to the concurrency slice").
- Nested brackets rejected.
- Compact (`a >> [b, c] >> d`) and YAML list (`- a / - [b, c] / - d`)
  forms both accepted; they normalize identically.

**Required when `flow:` is present:**
- Every `input[].id` and `expected[].id` must appear in `flow:`
  exactly once. Un-referenced entries are a hard error — flow is
  the single source of truth.
- Every input and every expected gets an `id:` (multi-input already
  required ids on inputs; in flow scenarios expecteds need them too).

**Field additions on `expected[]`:**

| Field | When | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | required when `flow:` is set | string | `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*`, unique. Names the observation for `${id.body_json.x}` substitution and flow ordering. |
| `of` | optional, reply observations only | string | Names an `input[].id` whose tagged reply this observation matches against. Defaults to the immediately-preceding fire in the linearized flow. Required only when ambiguity exists (multiple fires precede without an intervening reply observation). |

`match.task:` directive is **rejected** in flow scenarios; use
`expected[].of` instead. The legacy multi-input shape (no `flow:`)
continues to accept `match.task:`.

**Reply scoping (auto, no field for the common case):**
- One preceding fire before a reply observation → position-default;
  no `of:` needed.
- Multiple fires precede with no intervening reply observation →
  loader rejects as ambiguous; add `of: <input-id>`.

**New substitution form:**

| Token | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `${<expected-id>.body_json.<field>}` | A field of the matched event's `body_json` map (mongo doc, JetStream event body, reply payload, …). Walks dotted paths. |

Continues to work in flow scenarios: `${<input-id>.reply.body_json.x}`,
`${<input-id>.reply.status}`, and all existing placeholder /
`${now}` / `$auto` forms.

**Worked example:**

```yaml
input:
  - id: create
    site: site-a
    verb: nats_request
    subject: chat.user.${alice.account}.request.room.site-a.create
    payload: { name: Engineering }
    credential: ${alice.credential}

  - id: rename
    site: site-a
    verb: nats_request

## 7. Universal primitives — `location` + `site` rules

### 7.1 Site presence/absence

| `location` | `site:` |
|------------|---------|
| `reply` | **forbidden** — intrinsic to `input.site` |
| `cassandra_select` | **forbidden** — shared cluster |
| `mongo_find` | **required** |
| `jetstream_consume` | **required** |
| `nats_subscribe` | **required** |
| `logs_tail` | **required** |

Violating either rule is a loader error caught before any container
is booted.

### 7.2 `reply`

```yaml
- location: reply
  match:
    body_json:
      status: accepted
```

The synchronous reply payload from the `nats_request` verb. Injected
by the dispatcher into the `ReplyReader` buffer. `site:` is forbidden.
`args:` is not used.

**Pitfall: `reply` only fires for `nats_request`.** If your scenario's
`input.verb` is `jetstream_publish` (e.g. the message-send pipeline,
which publishes to `MESSAGES_<site>` and gets an async response on
`chat.user.<acct>.response.<requestId>`), the ReplyReader buffer
stays empty and `reply` assertions silently never match. For
async-response paths, use a `nats_subscribe` Warmer on the response
subject instead — see
`scenarios/drafts/message-pipeline-send-and-persist.yaml` Surface 1
for the worked pattern (hardcode the `requestId` in the payload so
the subscribe filter is known pre-fire).

### 7.3 `mongo_find`

```yaml
- location: mongo_find
  site: site-a
  args:
    collection: rooms
    filter:
      name: EngineeringFederated
  match:
    name: EngineeringFederated
    createdBy: ${alice.id}
  timeout: 5s
  polling: 100ms
```

Queries the named collection on the specified site's Mongo. The
`createdAt >= startTime` filter is auto-merged so assertions only
observe events that occurred after `Sandbox.StartTime`.

| Arg | Required | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `collection` | yes | Mongo collection name. |
| `filter` | yes | MongoDB query document. Tokens resolved. |

### 7.4 `cassandra_select`

```yaml
- location: cassandra_select
  args:
    query: "SELECT JSON * FROM messages_by_room WHERE room_id = ? AND bucket = ?"
    params: ["r-eng", 0]
  match:
    msg: "hello"
    room_id: "r-eng"
```

Queries the shared Cassandra cluster. `site:` is forbidden.

The poller scans a SINGLE JSON column per row (`SELECT JSON ...`).
Plain `SELECT *` returns multi-column rows that the scanner can't
unpack — always use `SELECT JSON *` (or another JSON-yielding shape).
Match keys are CQL column names in snake_case (`msg`, `room_id`,
`message_id`), NOT the camelCase JSON tags from the Go Message
struct.

| Arg | Required | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `query` | yes | CQL query string. `?` placeholders bound in order. |
| `params` | no | List of bind values. `StartTime` is bound to the first `?` when `params` is absent. |

**Timestamp-typed params.** A CQL `timestamp` column needs a Go
`time.Time` bound at the `?` — an `int64` lands as `bigint` and the
comparison silently fails. Opt in with the `ts:<unix-millis>` string
prefix on the param value; the poller converts it to `time.Time`
before binding. Example:

```yaml
- location: cassandra_select
  args:
    query: "SELECT JSON * FROM messages_by_id WHERE message_id = ? AND created_at = ?"
    params: ["m0parentmsg000000001", "ts:1748736000000"]
  match:
    message_id: "m0parentmsg000000001"
    tcount: 2
```

Malformed `ts:` bodies (non-numeric) pass through as the raw string so
`gocql` surfaces a precise type-mismatch error rather than silently
masking the typo.

### 7.5 `jetstream_consume`

```yaml
- location: jetstream_consume
  site: site-b
  args:
    stream: INBOX_site-b
    filter_subject: outbox.site-a.to.site-b.room.created
  match:
    roomId: ${input.payload.name}
  timeout: 10s
```

Replays messages from the JetStream stream via a `DeliverByStartTime`
ephemeral consumer. Uses `WithDomain(site)` to target the correct JS
domain.

| Arg | Required | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `stream` | yes | JetStream stream name. |
| `filter_subject` | yes | Subject filter for the ephemeral consumer. |

**Gzipped payloads** (push-notification fan-out, etc.) are
decompressed automatically before JSON decoding. Detection is by the
`Content-Encoding: gzip` header (case-insensitive) OR by the gzip
magic bytes `0x1f 0x8b` at the start of the payload — producers that
omit the header still get transparent decoding. `match.body_json:`
sees the decoded shape. If decompression fails, the raw (still-
compressed) bytes fall through to `body_raw` so the matcher / failure
detail surface what arrived.

### 7.6 `nats_subscribe`

```yaml
- location: nats_subscribe
  site: site-a
  args:
    subject: chat.room.r-eng.>
  match:
    eventType: room.created
```

Subscribes to a Core NATS subject. This poller implements `Warmer` —
the subscription opens before the verb fires. The subscription has no
replay; if the fire races ahead of `Warm`, events may be missed.

| Arg | Required | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `subject` | yes | NATS subject with optional `*`/`>` wildcards. |

### 7.7 `logs_tail`

```yaml
- location: logs_tail
  site: site-a
  args:
    container: room-service
    service: room-service
  match:
    msg: "room created"
    roomId: r-eng
```

Tails container stdout/stderr. The runner resolves the container name
as `<container>-<site>` (e.g. `room-service-site-a`).

| Arg | Required | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `container` | yes | Base container name (without site suffix). |
| `service` | no | Alias for log-line filtering; defaults to `container`. |

---

## 8. Substitution token grammar

Tokens are resolved in subject, payload, credential, match, and args
fields. Resolution occurs before the fire for `input` fields, and per
assertion for `expected[i]` fields.

```
token ::= "${" expr "}" | "$auto"

expr  ::= alias-field
        | "now"
        | "now" ws op ws duration
        | "date:" now-expr
        | "bucket(" col ")"
        | "input." input-field

now-expr ::= "now" | "now" ws op ws duration

alias-field  ::= alias "." field
alias        ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*    (declared in sites.*.seed.users)
field        ::= "account" | "id" | "jwt" | "nkey" | "credential"

op           ::= "+" | "-"
duration     ::= [0-9]+ unit
unit         ::= "ms" | "s" | "m" | "h"
col          ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*    (column name in cassandra_data row)

input-field  ::= "subject" | "payload." key | "requestId"
key          ::= [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_.]*
```

`$auto` resolves to a runtime-generated unique string of the form
`it-<runID>-room-auto-<N>`. Useful for room names and IDs that must
not collide across parallel or repeated runs.

### Where `${now ± d}` arithmetic actually resolves

`${now}` (with no offset) resolves **everywhere** — payloads,
subjects, match, args, `mongo_data`, `cassandra_data` rows — returning
`int64` millis.

`${now - 1h}` / `${now + 5m}` arithmetic-only resolves inside
**`cassandra_data` row values and `cassandra_select` args** today.
Outside those two contexts (payloads, subjects, match shapes,
`mongo_data`, `nats_subscribe` args, etc.) the bare arithmetic form
errors with `unknown path "now-1h": no placeholder "now-1h" resolved`
because the general substitute resolver doesn't recognize the offset
without the `date:` cast prefix.

The uniform-everywhere form is `${date:now ± d}` (next subsection),
which returns `time.Time` and resolves wherever any other token does.
The split exists for backward-compat: the Cassandra path predates the
cast wrapper and keeps the bare arithmetic for its int64 timestamps.

### Type cast: `${date:<now-expr>}` → `time.Time`

`${now}` returns an `int64` (unix millis) because that's what subjects
and payloads want. Some downstream consumers need a real Go
`time.Time` — most commonly **BSON Date** fields in `mongo_data`
seeds, where unmarshalling a `*time.Time` field from an int silently
fails. The `${date:<expr>}` wrapper casts a now-expression to
`time.Time`. Examples:

```yaml
mongo_data:
  - site: site-a
    collection: rooms
    docs:
      - _id: r-eng
        name: Engineering
        historySharedSince: ${date:now-1h}   # ← BSON Date, not int64
        retentionUntil:     ${date:now+30d}  # ← future Date
        createdAt:          ${date:now}      # ← current Date
```

- The inner `<expr>` is the same grammar as the standalone `${now ± d}`
  form (`now`, `now-1h`, `now+5m`, etc.).
- Result type is `time.Time` (UTC). BSON encodes it as Date; JSON
  payloads serialize it as ISO-8601 string; CQL bind sites accept it
  as `timestamp`.
- Malformed expression → hard error naming the bad token.
- The `date:` prefix is namespaced for future casts (`${objectid:...}`,
  `${binary:...}`) — same wrapper shape if more types ever land.

## 9. Loader errors

The loader rejects scenarios before any container is booted.

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `scenario: required` | `scenario:` field missing or empty. |
| `source: required` | `source:` field missing or empty. |
| `tag: must be "positive" or "negative"` | `tag:` is absent or has another value. |
| `sites: required` | `sites:` map absent or empty. |
| `sites key must be "site-a" or "site-b"` | An unknown site key was used. |
| `input: required` | `input:` block missing. |
| `input.site: required` | `site:` field absent from `input`. |
| `input.site: must be "site-a" or "site-b"` | Site value is not one of the two. |
| `input.verb: unknown verb "<v>"` | Verb not in `catalogs/verbs/`. |
| `expected: must have at least one entry` | `expected:` list is empty or absent. |
| `expected[N].location: unknown "<loc>"` | Location not in the registered poller set. |
| `expected[N]: site: forbidden for location "reply"` | `site:` present on a `reply` entry. |
| `expected[N]: site: forbidden for location "cassandra_select"` | `site:` present on a `cassandra_select` entry. |
| `expected[N]: site: required for location "<loc>"` | `site:` absent on a site-scoped entry. |
| `expected[N]: site: must be "site-a" or "site-b"` | Site value is not one of the two. |
| `forbidden token "${site}" in <field>` | The ambiguous `${site}` token was used. Write `site-a` or `site-b` literally. |
| `forbidden token "${siteA}" ...` | Same family of forbidden tokens. |
| `forbidden token "${service.*}" ...` | Service credentials are not exposed. |
| `seed.users.<alias>: unknown flag "<flag>"` | A flag not in `catalogs/seed-effects/` was set to `true`. |
| `cassandra_data: must not appear under sites` | `cassandra_data` was placed inside a site block; move it to top level. |

---

## 10. Validator errors (site-presence)

The static validator (`make validate`) also checks:

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `expected[N]: site must be absent for "reply"` | `site:` present when forbidden. |
| `expected[N]: site must be absent for "cassandra_select"` | Same. |
| `expected[N]: site required for "<loc>"` | `site:` absent when required. |
| `expected[N]: site "<s>" unknown` | Not `site-a` or `site-b`. |
| `input.site "<s>" not declared in sites:` | Input fires at a site with no seed block. Add the site to `sites:` even if its seed is empty. |

---

## 11. Matcher semantics — `matches_shape`

The default (and only) matcher for `expected[].match` is
`matches_shape`:

- **Subset deep match.** Extra fields in the observed payload are
  ignored; only fields the `match` block mentions must match.
- **Nested maps recurse** with the same subset semantics:
  `match: {body_json: {status: accepted}}` succeeds against
  `{body_json: {status: accepted, roomId: r-x, ...}}`.
- **Type normalisation.** JSON numbers decoded as float64 are
  normalized for integer comparison.
- **Struct payloads** (e.g. `ReplyPayload`) marshal to JSON and
  unmarshal as a generic map.
- **ROSM (Relative Order Subset Match).** When the expected match
  value is a list, the matcher walks the observed slice looking for
  each expected element in declaration order.

For "must NOT happen" assertions, set `not: true` — the loop uses
`Consistently(...).ShouldNot(...)`.

### 11.1 `outbox_payload:` — decoded inner subset for cross-site events

Cross-site federation events arrive on `OUTBOX_<site>` and
`INBOX_<site>` wrapped in `pkg/model.OutboxEvent`. The inner event
is serialized as `[]byte`, which Go's `encoding/json` writes as a
base64 string on the wire. A normal `body_json:` subset can reach
the envelope (`type`, `siteId`, `destSiteId`, `timestamp`) but the
inner content (`roomId`, `newName`, `member_added` fields, …) is
locked behind the base64.

The `outbox_payload:` directive in a `match:` block tells the
matcher to base64-decode `body_json.payload`, JSON-parse it, and
subset-match the decoded inner content against the value:

```yaml
- location: jetstream_consume
  site: site-a
  args:
    stream: OUTBOX_site-a
    filter_subject: outbox.site-a.to.site-b.room_renamed
  match:
    body_json:
      type: room_renamed         # envelope assertion (as before)
      siteId: site-a
      destSiteId: site-b
    outbox_payload:              # decoded inner subset
      roomId: r-shared
      newName: SharedChannelRenamed
```

**Semantics.** The matcher splits the expected shape into
"envelope" (everything except `outbox_payload`) and "directive" (the
value of `outbox_payload`). For each polled event:

1. Subset-match the envelope against `event.Payload` as usual. If
   the envelope mismatches, the event is skipped (the directive is
   NOT evaluated — envelope-level mismatch short-circuits).
2. If `outbox_payload:` is present, locate
   `event.Payload.body_json.payload` (must be a string),
   base64-decode it, JSON-parse the bytes, and subset-match against
   the directive value.
3. An event matches iff BOTH halves match.

**Failure reasons.** When the decode pipeline breaks, the
mismatch reason names the exact stage so the operator can localize
the producer- or wire-format regression:

- `outbox_payload: body_json is missing or not a map` — poller-
  shape regression; the event isn't a JSON object at all.
- `outbox_payload: body_json.payload is missing or not a string` —
  producer skipped the encode step.
- `outbox_payload: base64 decode of body_json.payload failed: …` —
  the payload bytes aren't standard base64.
- `outbox_payload: JSON parse of decoded payload failed: …` —
  schema-shape change; the inner format isn't JSON anymore.
- `outbox_payload: decoded subset mismatch: …` — decode works; the
  inner fields don't match the expected subset.

**When NOT to use it.** `outbox_payload:` is a one-trick directive
tuned for the OutboxEvent envelope shape (`body_json.payload` as a
base64 string). For other base64+JSON shapes — should they emerge
— add a sibling directive with an explicit `from:` path rather
than overload `outbox_payload`. For events whose inner content is
NOT base64-encoded (e.g. plain `ROOMS_<site>` canonical events
where the body is already JSON), use plain `body_json:` —
`outbox_payload:` would fail with "body_json.payload missing"
because the field isn't base64-wrapped to begin with.

## 12. Common mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `forbidden token "${site}"` | Used `${site}` in subject or payload. | Replace with the literal string `site-a` or `site-b`. |
| `expected[N]: site: required for location "mongo_find"` | `site:` missing on a `mongo_find` entry. | Add `site: site-a` or `site: site-b`. |
| `expected[N]: site: forbidden for location "reply"` | `site:` present on a `reply` entry. | Remove `site:` from that entry. |
| Assertion times out at `mongo_find` (cross-site) | Federation pipeline hasn't delivered the event within the default 5s window. | Extend `timeout:` to `10s` or longer for cross-site assertions. |
| Assertion times out at `mongo_find` (single-site) | `createdAt >= startTime` auto-filter excludes rows written before `Sandbox.StartTime`. | Confirm the scenario writes the row after setup; check filter. |
| Assertion times out at `nats_subscribe` | Subscription opened after the verb fired (race). | Ensure `nats_subscribe` entries are listed before `reply` — the runner processes Warmers in declaration order. |
| `seed.users.<alias>: unknown flag "X"` | Effect flag not in `catalogs/seed-effects/`. | Use `verified: true`; check catalog for new flags. |
| Federation cross-site assertion times out consistently | Production code may not federate on room-metadata events (only on message-send). | See "Open Concerns" in `README.md`; this is a known hypothesis the smoke run tests. |
