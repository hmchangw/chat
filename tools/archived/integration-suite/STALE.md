# STALE — single-site integration suite

**Status:** archived feature reference. **Not maintained.**

## Use the multi-site tool instead

All active integration testing — for both single-site and multi-site
scenarios — runs through:

```
tools/integration-suite-multisite/
```

Multi-site accepts sparse `sites:` maps, so a scenario that only
seeds and asserts against one site (e.g. `sites: {site-a: ...}` with
no `site-b` block) runs cleanly without paying any cross-site cost.
The infra-sanity scenarios at
`tools/integration-suite-multisite/scenarios/drafts/infra-sanity-rooms-pipeline-site-a.yaml`
are the canonical example of the single-site shape under the
multi-site runner.

## Why this folder exists

This tree is preserved as a **feature reference library**. Multi-site
does not yet have full parity with single-site on:

- `cases:` array grammar (one scenario file, multiple ordered
  experiments sharing a sandbox).
- Mishaps (`crash`, `mongo-partition-500ms`,
  `cassandra-partition-500ms`) — multi-site dropped these during
  the federation push and hasn't lifted them back.
- Single-purpose reader names (`mongo.rooms`, `logs.room-service`,
  `jetstream.rooms-canonical`) — multi-site uses generic
  `mongo_find`, `logs_tail`, `jetstream_consume` with `args:`.

When any of these capabilities is genuinely needed in multi-site,
this archive is where you go to crib the implementation. Until then
the code stays put.

## What's NOT here

- `docs/integration-suite-plan-ahead.md` stays in `docs/`. It's a
  forward-looking design note (envelope + DAG + chaos engine model)
  that applies to **both** suites — not single-site-specific. It's
  the north star for the next big lift on multi-site, not a
  retirement artifact.
- The findings doc `docs/integration-suite-multisite-findings.md`
  stays in `docs/`. It's a chat-app-team-facing report from the
  multi-site work, nothing to do with this archive.

## Separate module — out of the root `./...`

This tree has its own `go.mod` (module
`github.com/hmchangw/chat/tools/archived/integration-suite`), so it is
**not** part of the root module's package set. Root `make lint`,
`make test`, and `go build ./...` no longer descend here. That's
deliberate: the tool imports live `github.com/hmchangw/chat/pkg`
packages that drift as main evolves (e.g. the room-key Valkey→Mongo
move, #285), and while it lived in the root module every such drift
broke repo-wide CI for a frozen reference nobody runs. The boundary
stops that.

## Can I still run it?

Not as shipped, and that's expected. The `go.mod` is intentionally
minimal (no require graph / go.sum), so it does not build standalone —
and it currently references APIs main has since changed (#285 removed
the Valkey room-key store its seeder used). If you ever genuinely need
a diagnostic run, add `replace github.com/hmchangw/chat => ../../..`,
run `go mod tidy`, and fix whatever API drift surfaces. The
expectation is you won't — use `tools/integration-suite-multisite/`.
